## 1. Introduction

Anglo American Copper (AAC) has been operating in Chile for over 30 years. It has interests in six copper operations (either fully or partially owned) with 50.1% ownership of the Los Bronces Mine and Processing Plant facilities.

Following a recent restructure, AAC has been amalgamated with Anglo American Nickel to form Anglo American Base Metals (AABM), adding an additional 3 (2 x nickel and 1 x niobium) operations in Brazil to the company portfolio.

The two major revenue generating operations for AAC are Los Bronces and Collahuasi. AAC has 44% ownership of Collahuasi.

The long-term mine plan for Los Bronces has the Mine entering a harder ore body, which will result in reduced production rates. Management has therefore requested a review of current maintenance practices to see if improvements in plant/equipment reliability (and thus availability) will wholly or partially offset the expected reductions in production rates.

**Engagement:** AAC engaged Ausenco Rylson from Australia to conduct:
- Maintenance audit of systems and processes at the Processing Plant
- Plant/equipment capability study to model achievable reliabilities and availabilities using Best Asset Management Practice

**Investment:**
- 678,300 USD - Rylson8 Software and Service Desk support (including expenses)
- 168,300 USD - Rylson8 reliability tool Training to all AAC sites (including expenses)

---

## 2. The Audit and Study Findings

Following the audit and capability study at Los Bronces' fixed plant facilities, key findings included:

1. **Business processes:** Asset management business process maps do not exist
2. **Organisation structure:** Not functionally based; no formal Reliability Engineers exist; all asset management activities being executed by Maintenance Planners
3. **Strategy:** No formal Maintenance Department Strategy Document to align with business plans
4. **CMMS:** Ellipse needs review and overhaul to improve data quality
5. **Cost information:** Not all cost information being captured against work orders
6. **Maintenance strategies:** Need review and optimisation; the Plant was being maintained in **Reactive mode** with Planned/Unplanned ratio of **30/70** (Best Practice being **80/20**)
7. **Availability:** Results being achieved for Grinding Plant but not for Primary Crushing Plant
8. **Reliability:** Results well short of target for Confluencia SAG mill and Primary crushers
9. **Maintainability:** Results much better than target for Crushing and Grinding; workforce is reactive and "good at fixing things when they break; but not so good at preventing the failure in the first place"

**Current Maturity Level:** Level 2 on Ausenco Rylson's Asset Management Capability Maturity diagram. **Best Practice is at Levels 4-5.**

---

## 3. The Solution

### 3.1 Methodology

AAC has adopted a "Reliability Improvement" model:

| Area | Selected Action |
|------|----------------|
| Maintenance Audit | Ausenco Rylson audit methodology |
| Equipment Maintenance Strategies | Rylson8 |
| Business Processes | Anglo GTS20 |
| Defect Elimination Program | AAC methodology and Rylson8 (for RCA) |
| Life Cycle Analysis and Cost Optimisation | Rylson8 |

The methodology includes:
1. Determining the current state of asset management systems and processes
2. Developing/optimising equipment maintenance strategies using best practice methodology (RCM principles compliant with PAS55 and ISO 55000)
3. Developing structured business processes for asset management and maintenance
4. Developing and implementing a structured Defect Elimination Program
5. Conducting Asset Life Cycle Analysis to optimise costs and asset performance

**Underpinned by:**
- An effective functionally-based Maintenance Organisation
- Effective data capture and performance measurement systems
- Structured documentation and control systems

### 3.2 Rylson8

Rylson8 is an Enterprise Asset Management Software tool developed in-house by Ausenco Rylson. It has been developed based on accepted industry standards including **PAS 55** and **JA101**. Since its inception in 2009, Rylson8 has been rolled out to numerous asset intensive organisations.

## 4. Scope of Work Definition

### 4.1 Sites

The AAC sites covered under the scope:
- Las Tortolas and Los Bronces

### 4.2 Vision

AAC has committed to achieving best practice in asset management. Expected outcomes:
- Improved plant/equipment reliability
- Improved budgeting and cost performance
- Improved availability of 1-2% by 2015

> **Key insight:** High availability does not necessarily imply high reliability. On the other hand, high reliability definitely results in high sustainable availability.

### 4.3 Mission

AAC will implement a reliability improvement program delivering:
- Optimised use of current assets at all operations
- Reduced and/or optimised OPEX and CAPEX costs without impacting on availability
- Development of optimised Asset Life Cycle Plans

#### Mission Goals

- Zero damage HSEC
- Preventive Maintenance 80%, Corrective 20%
- Optimise Maintenance strategy and create Work Instructions
- Achieve mechanical availability of 93%
- Maximum OPEX optimization
- Achieve most effective labour usage
- Define Maintenance and Operational business rules
- Minimum unplanned Downtime
- Define Corporative Reliability (KPI) targets
- Identify key M&O Improvement Opportunities
- Implement Continuous Improvement methodologies
- Set standards to achieve process and procedures alignment
- Apply Benchmarking Asset Management Industry Standards

**Focus areas through Rylson8:**
- Asset Management
- Reliability Engineering
- Operations and Maintenance
- Equipment Life Cycle
- Whole of life expenditure Plan

| **TOTAL** | **581,613,169** | **17,448,395** | **46,529,054** | **87,241,975** |

#### Availability Improvement

A 1% improvement in availability results in a potential increase in revenue of $36m (based on 535,000 tonnes at USD6,700/tonne).

| Total Revenue 2012 (USD) | 1% in 2015 | 2% in 2016 | 3% in 2017 |
|--------------------------|------------|------------|------------|

The Project Team will develop a communication strategy which will:
- Inform the sites of the project justification
- Present the scope of work (Vision, Mission, Goals and targets, Deliverables, Project schedule)
- Advise the sites of resource requirements to be committed
- Advise the sites of the Rylson8 Training schedule
- Advise the sites of the support provided by AAC Corporate and the Rylson8 Vendor

---

## Appendices

### Appendix 1 - AAC Project Team Charter

**Purpose:** Manage the execution of the Project and provide site support for the set up and implementation of Rylson8.

**Objectives:**
- Ensure alignment of Project execution to the Company's vision, mission and goals
- Ensure the Project delivers agreed outcomes on time and within budget
- Ensure the Project is adequately resourced
- Ensure all key stakeholders understand the Project Scope and deliverables

### Appendix 2 - Project Steering Committee Charter

**Purpose:** Provide guidance to the Project Team to ensure alignment with the vision, mission and goals.

**Activities:**
- Monitor and review Project progress with regard to time and cost
- Monitor and review project deliverables against targets
- Monitor and review adequacy of resources
- Assist with communicating the Project's needs and deliverables

### Appendix 3 - Generic Maintenance Organisation Structure

The structure accounts for the functions of:
- Routine Maintenance (short-term maintenance)
- Shutdown management (long-term maintenance)
- Asset management (asset "ownership"; CM program; defect elimination; structural integrity)
- Engineering (engineering studies and investigations; plant upgrades; drafting; technical records)

### Appendix 4 - Rylson8 AAC Asset Data Transfer Process

**Note:** The links involving data transfer between Rylson8 and Ellipse MAY require Ellipse Connector scripts. Connectors may be appropriate but not necessarily in all data transfer instances. It depends on the nature of the entities involved and the volume of data being transferred. Ellipse connectors are typically used to create Standard Jobs, MSTs, EGI component profiles and materials uploads/cataloguing.

Manual data exchange to Ellipse configurations or data may also be equally appropriate.
