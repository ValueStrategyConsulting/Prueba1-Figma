## Flowchart 7: R8 Implementation Summary (End-to-End)

**Page 7 of 8 -- Consolidated single-page overview**

This flowchart consolidates the entire R8 implementation lifecycle into a single diagram with three major stages:

```
=== STAGE 1: R8 DEPLOYMENT ===
[R8 Configuration]
    |---> Install R8 on client server
    |---> Provide user access
    |---> Set up R8 database
    |---> User training
[EAMS Configuration]
    (parallel system setup)

=== STAGE 2: R8 IMPLEMENTATION ===
[Data Sources]
    |---> AS&R R8 Library Generic Tactics
    |---> Existing site information
    v
[Populate Local R8 Database with Data]
    v
[Conduct Maint. Tactic Optimisation Workshop]
    v
[Technical Review] --> [Client Approval] --> [Data Validation]
    v
[Upload Sheet Preparation] --> [Test Upload in EAMS] --> [Client Acceptance]
    v
[Site Validation]
    v
[Asset Tactic Deployment]

=== STAGE 3: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ===
[Review Asset Maintenance History]
    v
[Recommend Asset Tactic Changes Based on Maintenance Data]
    v
[Approval for Changes to Asset Tactics]
    v
[Update Asset Tactic Data in R8]

    |
    +---> Loop back to Stage 2
```

## Flowchart 8: Organizational Deployment Structure

**Page 8 of 8 -- Corporate hierarchy and deployment scope**

This diagram shows the organizational hierarchy for R8 deployment across multiple commodity groups and sites:

```
                    [AS&R Group / Corporate]
                           |
        +------------------+------------------+
        |                  |                  |
  [Commodity        [Commodity         [Commodity
   Group 1]          Group 2]          Group N]
     |                  |                  |
  +--+--+          +--+--+          +--+--+
  |     |          |     |          |     |
[Site] [Site]   [Site] [Site]    [Site] [Site]
```

### Deployment Scope

| Commodity | Region | Sites | ERP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thermal Coal | South Africa / Colombia | 10 | SAP |
| Platinum | Africa | 22 | SAP |
| Diamonds | Africa | 11 | -- |
| Iron Ore | Africa / Brazil | -- | -- |
| Manganese | Africa / Australia | 8 | -- |
| Met Coal | Australia | 10 | -- |
| Copper | Chile | 4 | SAP |
| Nickel | Brazil | 3 | Ellipse |

### Key Flow per Level

- **AS&R Group**: Establishes project, selects software, configures R8, develops generic tactics library
- **Commodity Groups**: Appoints AS&R members, receives training, sets up commodity-level R8 databases
- **Sites**: Appoints R8 users, receives training, populates site databases, conducts tactic workshops, uploads to EAMS
