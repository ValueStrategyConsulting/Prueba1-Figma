## Core Business Areas

The methodology is built on three core pillars:

| Area | Description |
|---|---|
| **Asset Management and Maintenance Models** | Frameworks for managing physical assets throughout their lifecycle |
| **Reliability Engineering and Life Cycle Analysis** | Engineering discipline focused on reliability, availability, and total cost of ownership |
| **Culture Change and Innovation** | Organizational transformation to embed reliability-thinking |

---

## Maintenance Pillars

The approach believes that working on the maintenance pillars and excellence in associated activities is the key to success:

| Pillar | Description |
|---|---|
| **Management Model** | Overall governance and structure for maintenance management |
| **Maintenance Plan** | The specific tactics, tasks, frequencies, and resources for each asset |
| **Reliability Engineering** | Data-driven analysis of failure modes, consequences, and risk |
| **Execution** | Performing the planned maintenance work safely and efficiently |
| **Use of Technology** | Leveraging software tools (like R8) to manage and optimize maintenance |

---

## What is Rylson8?

Rylson8 is a software platform for:

- **Asset criticality analysis** development
- **Maintenance plan improvement** and optimization
- **Operational budget optimization**

It is intuitive, user-friendly, and easy to use.

## The 3-Step Maintenance Improvement Process

The process consists of three major stages:

```
[Step 1: Review Maintenance Activities]
    |
    v
[Step 2: Improve Maintenance Plans and Update in ERP]
    |
    v
[Step 3: Optimize Performance and Operational Budget]
```

### Step 1: Review Maintenance Activities

**Key Industry Challenges Addressed:**

- Standardization of asset criticality analysis
- Decentralized efforts with multiple standards
- Maturity in the maintenance plan review process
- Definition of failure modes per equipment

### Step 2: Improve Maintenance Plans and Update in ERP

**Key Industry Challenges Addressed:**

- Resource adjustment for maintenance task execution
- Balancing resources across maintenance plans
- Objective and valuable work instructions
- Technical asset and spare parts lists per maintenance task, all loaded in the ERP (Ellipse/SAP)

### Step 3: Optimize Performance and Operational Budget

**Key Industry Challenges Addressed:**

- Controlling the budget instead of just reporting it
- Obtaining activity-based maintenance budgets
- Technical justification for budgets and investments
- Risk-based cost reduction decisions

## How Step 1 Works

The detailed process within Step 1 (Review Maintenance Activities):

| Sub-step | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hierarchy** | Define your hierarchy at the component level |
| **Criticality** | Rank asset criticality |
| **Functions and Functional Failures** | Define what is expected from each component |
| **Failure Modes** | Manage the database of failure modes |
| **Maintenance Tactics** | Determine what is technically and economically viable |

```
[Hierarchy] --> [Criticality] --> [Functions & Functional Failures] --> [Failure Modes] --> [Maintenance Tactics]
```

---

## How Step 2 Works

The detailed process within Step 2 (Improve Maintenance Plans and Update in ERP):

| Sub-step | Description |
|---|---|
| **Maintenance Tasks** | Define everything necessary for work execution |
| **Resource Allocation** | For each maintenance task, obtain labour and replacement profiles |
| **Task Packaging** | Consolidate what and when to do, by type of labour |
| **Maintenance Strategy** | Create master data |
| **Resource Balancing** | Balance labour and replacement profiles across all plans |

```
[Maintenance Tasks] --> [Resource Allocation] --> [Task Packaging] --> [Maintenance Strategy] --> [Resource Balancing]
```

## How Step 3 Works

The detailed process within Step 3 (Optimize Performance and Operational Budget):

| Sub-step | Description |
|---|---|
| **Manage Costs and Schedule Replacements** | Schedule replacements based on condition, useful life, and risk |
| **Production Plan** | Adjust maintenance to comply with the production plan |
| **Life Cycle Simulation** | Know availability and failure rate throughout the asset's life |
| **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** | TCO analysis for investment decision making |
| **OPEX Management** | Administer the budget instead of just reporting it |

```
[Cost Management & Scheduling] --> [Production Plan Alignment] --> [Life Cycle Simulation] --> [TCO Analysis] --> [OPEX Budget Management]
```

## Ausenco Methodology for Maintenance Plan Development

The methodology follows an automated process through Rylson8:

| Phase | Description | Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Tactics and Plans Definition** | Use of R8 libraries and existing site plans | Automated via Rylson8 |
| **One-on-One Technical Interview** | Interview with technician/supervisor | In-person or remote |
| **Tactics and Plans Validation** | Validation with PCM (Maintenance Planning and Control) | Technical interview |
| **SAP Upload Sheets** | Generated from Rylson8 | Automated export |
| **Maintenance Plan Validation** | Final validation before upload | Client review |
| **SAP Upload** | Load into SAP | Data migration |

```
[Tactics & Plans Definition] --> [Technical Interview] --> [Validation] --> [SAP Upload Sheets] --> [Plan Validation] --> [SAP Upload]
```

## Key Implementation Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Remote Work and Agile Project Management** | Use of collaborative platforms for planning, S-curve tracking, communication, and interviews |
| **Joint Development and Validation** | Development and validation of maintenance plans together with the operational areas (accountability and buy-in) |
| **Use of Maintenance Libraries** | Leverage plant/mine maintenance models and libraries |
| **Use of Rylson8 Software** | Central tool for all maintenance strategy work |

---

## Results and Visualization

The methodology provides total visualization of:

- Type, quantity, and distribution of maintenance per equipment and process area
- Resource requirements and scheduling
- Cost projections and budget impacts

---
