6. **Client Approval**
7. **Data Validation**
8. **Site Validation**
9. **EAMS Upload Sheet Preparation**
10. **Test Upload in EAMS**
11. **Client acceptance**

> Returns to Phase 3; proceeds to Phase 5 and Phase 6

---

## Phase 5: Asset Tactic Continuous Improvement

**Page 5 of 6 -- Rylson8 Deployment and Implementation Project**

This phase establishes the continuous improvement loop for deployed tactics.

1. **Deploy tactics** at pre-determined frequency from EAMS
2. **Collate W/O information** after execution
3. **Upload relevant W/O details** into EAMS
4. **Review asset maintenance history** to identify improvements to tactic/s
5. **Recommend asset tactic changes**
6. **Site approval to change tactics**
7. **Update tactics** in site R8 database
8. **Upload revised asset tactics** into EAMS

> Cycle repeats; connects to Phase 4 and Phase 6

---

## Phase 6: Generic Asset Tactic Development

**Page 6 of 6 -- Rylson8 Deployment and Implementation Project**

This phase builds and maintains the corporate-level generic tactics library.

1. **Identify assets** for inclusion in generic asset tactics library
2. **Collate tactics information** for assets from all available sources
3. **Populate R8 database** with tactic information
4. **Optimise asset tactics**
5. **Technical Review**
