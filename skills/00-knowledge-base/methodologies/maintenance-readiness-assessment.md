## 1. Operational Readiness (OR) Context

Operational Readiness (OR) is the process of preparing the site's operations, maintenance and supporting team members to manage new assets which are either under construction or in the procurement phase. At time of delivery or handover, the operational team must be ready to assume ownership of the assets with the backing of appropriate documentation, infrastructure, tools, systems and training.

### 1.1 Case for Operational Readiness

Without an OR process, assets will be operated and maintained with unnecessary waste leading to higher life cycle costs. Problems addressed by OR include:

- Senior management not clear on business expectations of new assets
- Safety risks from design oversights, manufacture and construction deficiencies
- People not clear on their role or interaction with other departments
- Poorly trained or low-skilled personnel
- Contractor support not aligned with operations and maintenance requirements
- Parts not available when needed or of lower quality than required
- Equipment inadequate for the operational duty or difficult to maintain reliably
- Inadequate checking of installation quality leading to latent defects
- Inadequate handover of documentation and drawings
- Information systems inadequately established
- Sustainability issues (environmental risks, energy consumption, community issues)

> **Key Finding:** The transition from execution into operations is where high-value leakage occurs; case studies show destruction of approximately 30% of initial study value.

### 1.2 Maintenance Readiness as a Subset of OR

This MR Guideline focuses only on the maintenance and reliability related activities of Operational Readiness. It guides the application of the AS&R best practices as defined in the Asset Strategy and Reliability (AS&R) Framework and Maturity Assessment on new investments (projects).

### 1.3 AS&R Framework Reference

The activities in this Guideline reside mainly in the PLAN phase of the PLAN-DO-CHECK-ACT cycle. Positioned at the start of this cycle, MR lays the important foundation for the overall successful application of the Operating Model (AOM) and P101 Strategy.

The Guideline starts with understanding the Production Strategy of a new investment, covers all Service Strategy elements, and ends with the ideal state where an AS&R Assessment has been conducted.

### 1.4 Investment Development Model (IDM) Reference

The IDM process provides the framework to develop and deliver investments. It commences with identification of a business opportunity and concludes with a Post Investment Review (PIR).

| IDM Stage | Stage Objective |
|---|---|
| Opportunity | Confirm at a high-level that potential exists to deliver a positive business case |
| Concept | Confirm a robust business case and identify alternatives |
| Pre-Feasibility A | Refine alternatives and recommend preferred alternative |
| Pre-Feasibility B | Define investment details for selected alternative and confirm business case |
| Feasibility | Refine investment details necessary to execute the business case |
| Execution | Execute the investment on time and within budget |
| Operation | Operate the investment, achieving the business case |

At the conclusion of each stage, investments must pass a gate with an independent review by the Investment Assurance team.

---

## 2. Maintenance Readiness (MR) Framework

The MR framework acts as a one-page summary of all key maintenance readiness activities.

### 2.1 Characteristics of the MR Framework

- Activities are grouped per IDM stages, running from bottom left to top right
- Horizontal position represents relative timing of each activity within a stage
- Activities are colour-coded into eight key themes running horizontally

### The Eight Key MR Themes

| Theme | Description |
|---|---|
| **Engineering** | Engineering and Design activities (reference only). Many MR activities are dependent on engineering deliverables. |
| **Safety, Health and Environment** | Governed by the SHE Way. SHE focus should be fully integrated into all activities. Brown circle icon highlights SHE considerations. |
| **MR Planning & Budgeting** | Should be fully incorporated in wider OR Planning and Budgeting to create an integrated OR Plan and Budget. |
| **Maintenance and Reliability** | Core maintenance and reliability activities across investment stages. |
| **Information Management** | Systems and master data to support M&R activities in the Operational stage. |
| **Spares and Support** | Establishment of maintenance spares requirements and technical support requirements. |
| **Manpower and Training** | Appropriate resourcing (manpower), outsourcing considerations, contractor management. |
| **Operations** | Operational activities with significant interface with maintenance and reliability. |

### 2.2 Intended Audience

| Audience | Application |
|---|---|
| Investment or Project Team | Understanding of M&R activities required during project stages, budget estimating, activity guidance |
| End-User | Understanding of what should be conducted as part of the project, and what activities may still be required after handover |
| Investment Assurance Team | Insight on M&R activities that should be completed at each stage during gate reviews |

### 2.3 Application

Maintenance readiness should be used for:
- Greenfield establishment of a new mine or processing facility
- Brownfield extension of a mine or processing facility
- Procurement of new heavy equipment
- Extensive rehabilitation of a major process or facility

---

## 3. Engineering Theme

The Engineering Design activities are included purely as reference to illustrate dependencies between MR activities and engineering design stages.

### Key Interfaces

1. **Notional Design and Asset Strategies** (Pre-Feasibility A): Consolidated maintenance and reliability know-how should be input to the Notional Design
2. **Reliability Analysis and Detailed Design** (Pre-Feasibility B): Iterative process between reliability activities and design
3. **Asset Tactics and Final Design** (Feasibility): Study the Final Design to determine Asset Tactics approach
4. **Optimised Design** (Operations): Extent of post-operational changes indicates how much early involvement was granted to M&R professionals

### Engineering Design Deliverables by Stage

| Design Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Notional Designs** | 50% design complete. Sufficient detail to evaluate alignment with Asset Strategies. |
| **Notional Design (early Pre-Feasibility B)** | 60% design complete. Conceptual design with PFDs, P&IDs, equipment layouts. |
| **Detailed Design (end of Pre-Feasibility B)** | 85% design complete. Equipment selected, locations finalised, cable/piping routes, walkways, lifting facilities. |
| **Final Design (end of Feasibility)** | 95% design complete. Final check of maintenance platforms, lighting, power outlets, water outlets. |
| **As-Built Design** | Final Design updated with any approved changes during Execution. |

---

## 4. Safety, Health and Environment Theme

SHE practices are governed by the SHE Way. The primary purpose is to highlight opportunities to introduce SHE considerations at appropriate activities.

### SHE Considerations for Specific MR Activities

| MR Activity | SHE Consideration |
|---|---|
| Reliability Analysis | Include SHE representative in review sessions. Conduct additional Safety Review on completion of RAM Analysis. Review Isolation system. |
| Asset Tactics Development Plan | Include assets that pose significant SHE risk. |
| Work Management Processes | Integrate Permit to Work (PTW) system with work order system. |
| Condition Monitoring Strategy | Identify CM practices that can reduce or mitigate SHE risks. |
| Asset Tactics Development | Consider Structural Inspection and Maintenance Management (SIMM) activities for steel and concrete structures. |

### SHE Design Precedence

Risk Elimination is the least expensive and most effective method of handling SHE risks. If addressed early in the design process, risks can often be eliminated at almost no cost. Methods include:
- Substitution of safer materials
- Simplification to eliminate hazards
- Decoupling tightly coupled systems
- Reducing and simplifying interfaces

---

## 5. MR Planning and Budgeting Theme

### 5.1 MR Strategy

The MR Strategy facilitates input from the maintenance team at the earliest possible stage. It should address:
- **Change Management Strategy** - Increase stakeholder and operations involvement during early project stages
- **MR Stakeholders List** - Identified with power/interest rating using the Power/Interest Grid
- **MR Stakeholder Engagement Communication Plan** - Specify communication methods, reports, formats, and meeting intervals

### 5.2 MR Budget

| Stage | Budget Activity |
|---|---|
| Concept Stage | Request initial funding |
| Pre-Feasibility A | Deliver estimated MR budget (percentage of total IDM budget) |
| Pre-Feasibility B | Deliver firm MR budget with input from MR Plan |
| Each Stage Gate | Review and update MR budget along with project budget |

### 5.3 MR Plan and Project Management

The MR Plan is developed in early Pre-Feasibility B for subsequent stages. It is based on the MR Framework activities and considers unique project aspects:
- Factory testing of equipment and components
- Modelling and simulation of plant performance
- Training of operational staff
- Decommissioning of old equipment

The approved MR Plan is integrated with the Project Execution Plan (PEP) at each Stage Gate.

### 5.4 MR Team

The MR Team should be a cross-functional group with some members earmarked to form part of the operational maintenance team after commissioning. Specialist activities may require internal AS&R specialists or external service providers.

The **Reliability Engineer** is a key member of the MR Team.

### 5.5 MR Review and Evaluation of Success

Success evaluated on two fronts:
1. **Performance evaluation** of MR Plan, Budget, Team, and MR-specific KPIs
2. **AS&R Maturity Assessment** on the investment

#### Example MR KPIs

| KPI | Category |
|---|---|
| AS&R Assessment Maturity Score >3 | Quality |
| Compliance to Labour Budget at start of Operations | Cost |
| Compliance of Spare ID to documents submitted | Delivery |
| Handover sign-offs with completed punch list | Delivery/Quality |
| Critical Procedures in place (SHE included) | Risk/Delivery |
| Actual vs Budget Expenditure | Cost |
| Life cycle unit cost defined | Cost |
| % completion of training matrix | Delivery |
| Ramp-up performance (asset and SHE) | Performance/Risk |
| Asset tactics deployed in SAP for all Criticality 1 equipment | Delivery/Quality |
| % Project risks mitigated into operational practices | Risk |

## 6. Maintenance and Reliability Theme

The core maintenance and reliability activities that should be conducted as part of operational readiness.

### 6.1 Asset Strategies

Asset Strategies (also called Asset Management Plans in ISO 55000) provide a high-level approach to manage an asset type across its life cycle. They should encapsulate the combined experience of managing an asset type and summarise future application intent.

**Key distinction:** Asset Strategies cover operating context, refurbishment/replacement norms, component change-out norms, standardisation and replacement technologies. Asset Tactics (Section 6.4) are focused on specific maintenance activities during the operational stage.

### 6.2 Service Strategy

Setting the production and service strategies involves an iterative process to achieve the required level of availability and reliability. Key questions:
- What is the planned operating schedule? 24/7?
- What maintenance windows or shutdowns are allowed?
- What are the specific availability requirements?
- Any specific levels of redundancy required?

### 6.3 Reliability Analysis

Reliability is "designed in" - it is primarily a design attribute. During design stages, 80% of the asset's operational Life Cycle Cost (LCC) is determined. Once operational, Reliability Engineers have only about 20% scope for improving LCC.

#### RAM / RAMBO / RAMBOS

| Process | Scope |
|---|---|
| **RAM** | Reliability, Availability and Maintainability review of system and assets |
| **RAMBO** | RAM + Buildability + Operability |
| **RAMBOS** | RAMBO + Safety (or Security for precious metal applications) |

#### Supporting Tools and Techniques

**Criticality Analysis:** Directs attention to high-risk assets requiring greater reliability analysis.

**FMEA / FMECA:** Applied on high-risk assets to identify Failure Modes needing evaluation and mitigation.

**Reliability Block Modelling and Simulations:** Model connectivity of production assets, assess reliability and availability as a collective system. Can answer:
- Probability of achieving performance requirements?
- How much will a design change improve probability?
- Will asset tactic changes improve probability?
- Series vs. parallel configurations?
- Effect of upstream/downstream process interruptions?

**Life Cycle Cost Analysis:** 80% of LCC is determined during design stage. For mobile equipment, LCC analysis is standard practice; for fixed assets, LCC models are rarely developed but are essential.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** Enables evaluation of the overall effect on Net Present Value (NPV) of various asset options.

#### Reliability Analysis Activity Sequence

**Pre-Feasibility B (Reliability Specification):**
1. Technical Object Structure
2. Asset Specifications
3. Reliability Specifications
4. First-round RAM session
5. Initial Reliability Block Diagram (optional)
6. Reliability Report

**Feasibility (Reliability Analysis):**
1. Criticality Analysis and FMECA
2. Develop/review Reliability Block Diagram or simulation
3. Life Cycle Costing for significant asset selection decisions
4. 2nd RAM session (full, cross-functional)
5. Further focused RAM sessions as needed
6. Security Review (if applicable)
7. Final asset specifications
8. Reliability Report

#### Maintainability Review

Reviews system and asset design to ensure people can operate and maintain equipment safely and efficiently. Includes:
- Asset standardisation review to minimise variation in asset types
- Reference the Technical Object Structure to ensure all asset types are covered
- Outcome informs asset specifications for procurement packages

#### Reliability and Safety Correlation

- Strong correlation (0.87) between OEE and LTIFR
- Organisations are 28% more likely to have incidents with reactive versus planned maintenance
- In organisations where reliability increased tenfold, injury frequency and severity reduced tenfold

### 6.4 Asset Tactics

Asset Tactics development is defined by the AS&R Asset Tactics Deployment Process.

**Technical Object Structure (TOS):** Best practice is to start developing SAP TOS as soon as possible. Ensuring alignment between P&ID numbering, SAP numbering, and C&I/Electrical numbering reduces SHE risk during lockouts and isolations.

**Asset Tactics Development Plan:** A detailed plan developed during Feasibility covering:
- Which assets go through the full ATD process
- How remaining assets' tactics will be developed
- Resources earmarked (reference RACI chart)
- Estimated duration

> **Example:** A METSO P1000 Crusher FMECA defined 498 maintenance activities. Process to deploy in SAP: (1) Group tasks by frequency, (2) Detailed planning including pre/post activities, (3) SAP Master data design, (4) Creation of SAP objects. Result: 73 Maintenance Plans, 130 Maintenance Items, 398 Task Lists, 25 Detailed job procedures, 170 PM inspection documents, 260 linked spare parts.

**Asset Tactics and SHE:** Maintenance of civil assets (concrete and steel structures) is often overlooked. Structural Inspection and Maintenance Management (SIMMS) tasks must also be considered.

### 6.5 Work Management

Work management is the collective term for the process to reliably identify, validate, plan, schedule, allocate, execute, review, close and capture all work and records.

**Prerequisites for optimal work management:**
- Configured SAP (asset registers, maintenance tasks, spares, BOMs, work instructions, SOPs)
- Access to tools and facilities
- Documented and communicated WM process
- Related procedures defined, people trained, roles assigned
- Integration with safety and PTW procedures
- Access to material management function
- Performance measures tracked

### 6.6 Condition Monitoring

Condition monitoring involves continuous or periodic data measurement, analysis and diagnosis of equipment failure modes. Minimum technologies to implement:
- Thermal imaging
- Vibration monitoring
- Oil sampling and analysis
- Ultrasound monitoring
- Static and dynamic electrical testing
- Wear monitoring (conveyors, chutes, crusher liners)
- Pipe and vessel thickness monitoring
- Non-destructive testing
- Online monitoring systems per OEM recommendations

### 6.7 Total Fluid Management

80% of hydraulic component failures are fluid related. The Total Fluid Management Strategy covers:
- Selection, procurement, storage, dispensing, testing, replacement and disposal of fluids
- Standardisation across fluid types (fuels, oils, lubricants, grease, hydraulic fluid, coolants)
- Supplier evaluation (quality, remote supply capability, technical support, CM services, reconditioning)
- Sampling and testing procedures aligned with Work Management and CM Strategy

### 6.8 Critical Spares Analysis

Not all spares assigned to a critical asset are critical spares. Criteria for critical classification:
1. Underlying asset rated as critical during asset criticality assessment
2. Further analysis indicates absence would have significant risk impact

Maintenance and Reliability team responsibilities:
- Identify critical spares
- Develop maintenance and preservation activities for storage
- Ensure spares criticality ratings captured in ERP (SAP MM)

### 6.9 Tools, Facilities and Support Requirements

**Facilities:** Workshops, services (power, light, compressed air), office facilities, ablutions, canteens, signage, fluid storage, waste management, spares stores, housing.

**Maintenance Tools:** Workshop tools, CM instruments, hand tools, portable electrical equipment, lifting equipment.

**Vehicles:** Cars, trucks, pickups, forklifts, access equipment.

### 6.10 Operational Maintenance and Reliability Management

By Commissioning stage close-out, the foundation for maintenance management and reliability management functions must be in place. Key roles: Reliability Engineer and Engineering Manager.

## 7. Information Management Theme

This theme considers information systems in support of maintenance and reliability activities.

### 7.1 EAMS Standard and Plan

| Investment Type | Approach |
|---|---|
| Greenfield | Adopt the latest SAP AOP Blueprint or Standards Manual |
| Brownfield | Review current SAP AOP and determine gaps; consider upgrade |
| Expansion | Adopt the Operation's current standard |

**Core master data entails:**
- Equipment list / Functional locations using coding system (with attributes: criticality, location, size, make, model)
- Asset care plans (task lists, durations, tradespersons, spares, tools)
- Spares master list (criticality, minimum levels, supplier)
- Work Centres, planning plant, planner groups
- Financial master data (cost centres, GL codes, value)

**System integrations to consider:**
- Document management systems (Documentum, SAP DMS)
- Permit to Work system (e.g., IntelliPermits)
- Mini Risk Assessment System
- Time Usage Model KPI reporting
- FutureSmart Mining (digitisation, IIoT)
- Condition Monitoring systems
- Fuel/lube dispensing systems
- SCADA interface

### 7.2 Technical Object Structure (TOS)

The SAP TOS is the golden thread structuring and linking all MR activities from Pre-Feasibility B onwards. The numbering system and structure must be agreed upon at the start of Pre-Feasibility B.

TOS is the starting point for:
- RAM analysis sessions
- Criticality analysis
- Asset tactics development
- Spares requirements determination
- Asset performance measurements

### 7.3 Performance Measures

Key metrics to monitor and control:
- **Outcome/lagging metrics:** Availability, utilisation, MTBF, MTTR, cost
- **Process/leading indicators:** Work Management metrics, asset health measures

Data capture considerations include mobile asset onboard systems, fixed asset SCADA integration, IIoT/Digitisation strategy.

### 7.4 Technical Information

Technical information includes specifications, drawings, vendor manuals, operations and maintenance procedures, training materials, as-built drawings, calibration certificates, baseline measurements.

Key practices:
- Specify information requirements on asset purchase enquiry documents
- Request FMEA templates from OEMs to accelerate Asset Tactics
- Request RAM studies from suppliers on specific systems
- Request parts information in SAP MM upload format
- Request maintenance procedures in appropriate format

### 7.5 Management of Change

A document management system is essential. It should ensure:
- All project information properly developed, reviewed and stored
- Document register accurately maintained
- Coding and naming conventions applied consistently
- Configuration management enabled

### 7.6 Chart of Accounts

| Costing Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Asset Costing | Total cost of owning an asset over its life |
| Activity Costing | Total cost for a certain activity (e.g., drilling or recovery) |
| Responsibility Costing | Actual vs. budget costing for a specific maintenance department |
| Metal Accounting | Cost to produce 1 kg of a specific commodity |

- **Warehousing:** Correct storage and preservation per ASR specification
- **Repairable Items:** Formal management process addressing responsibilities

### 8.3 Material Master

The SAP MM material master is the main source of material-specific data. All spares and materials should be coded with standardised, unique material numbers. Include details of the true OEM (not just the equipment supplier).

### 8.4 BOMs (Bill of Materials)

Equipment-specific representation of the material master. Benefits include:
- Planners do not need to search for part numbers
- Parts linked to task lists can reserve stock
- Accurate parts retrieval and purchasing
- Accurate min/max order parameter calculation

### 8.5 Parameters

Inventory optimisation parameters include:
- Stock levels for each part
- Minimum and maximum order levels
- Reorder levels
- Economic Order Quantities (EOQ)

Use ABC Analysis (consumption-based) and VED Analysis (criticality-based). Parameters should be regularly updated.
