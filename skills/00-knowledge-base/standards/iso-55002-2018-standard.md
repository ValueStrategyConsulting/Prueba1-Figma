## 0. Introduction

### 0.1 General

This document provides guidelines for implementing an asset management system (called "sistema de gestion de activos") in accordance with the requirements of ISO 55001.

It provides explanatory text to clarify the requirements specified in ISO 55001 and examples to support implementation. It does not provide guidelines for managing specific asset types.

This document provides guidance for:
- a) Those involved in establishing, implementing, operating, maintaining and improving an asset management system
- b) Those involved in developing asset management activities, including service providers

### 0.2 Assets, Asset Management and the Asset Management System

An asset is something that has potential or real value for an organization. Asset management enables an organization to obtain value from assets in achieving its organizational objectives.

The asset management system includes:
- a) Asset management policy (see 5.2)
- b) Asset management objectives (see 6.2)
- c) Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP / PEGA)
- d) Asset management plans (see 6.2.2)
- e) Support activities (see Chapter 7)
- f) Operational planning and control (see Chapter 8)
- g) Performance evaluation (see Chapter 9)
- h) Improvement activities (see Chapter 10)
- i) Relationship/interaction with other relevant policies, processes and management systems

### 0.3 Structure of this Document

This document follows a structure and sequence of chapters similar to ISO 55001. A distinction is made between:
- **Assets and asset portfolio** (portafolio de activos)
- **Asset management** (gestion de activos)
- **Asset management system** (sistema de gestion de activos)

Four key pathways are of critical importance in designing and improving the system:
1. **Line of sight** from organizational context through asset management policy, SAMP and asset management plans to operations
2. **Objectives** derived from organizational objectives to strategic asset management objectives, to asset management objectives, often translated into KPI hierarchies
3. **Decision-making criteria** and decision-making processes
4. **Risk management** developed at all levels, from top organizational level down to daily operations

The alignment of these four elements is one of the key aspects of asset management.

### 0.4 Language Applied

- "shall" (debe) indicates a requirement
- "should" (deberia) indicates a recommendation
- "may" (puede) indicates a permission, possibility or capability

## 4. Context of the Organization

### 4.1 Understanding the Organization and Its Context

#### 4.1.1 General

When establishing or reviewing an asset management system, ensure its design and scope are coherent and aligned with the external and internal context of the organization.

#### 4.1.2 External Context

External context considerations include:
- a) Social, cultural, political, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, competitive and natural environment factors
- b) Key drivers and trends potentially impacting organizational objectives
- c) Relationships, perceptions and values of external stakeholders

#### 4.1.3 Internal Context

Internal context considerations include:
- a) Governance requirements
- b) Policies, objectives and strategies
- c) Organizational culture and values
- d) Organizational structure, roles, responsibilities and authorities
- e) Size and complexity of the organization
- f) Capabilities (capital, time, people, systems, technologies)

- q) Feedback from previous self-assessments, internal audits, third-party reviews

Strategic-level tools include SWOT analysis and PESTLE analysis.

### 4.2 Understanding the Needs and Expectations of Stakeholders

#### 4.2.1 General

The organization should identify and review stakeholders relevant to the asset management system, their needs and expectations, and the value they could receive from assets.

#### 4.2.2 Internal Stakeholders

- Employees
- Functional groups (engineering, finance, accounting, maintenance, operations, procurement, logistics)
- Shareholders, management consortia, owners

#### 4.2.3 External Stakeholders

- Customers, users
- Suppliers, service providers, contractors
- Non-governmental organizations
- Government organizations, regulatory authorities
- Investors or taxpayers
- Local community
- Those interested in social, financial, environmental sustainability
- Financial institutions, rating agencies, brokers, insurers
- Employee representatives

#### 4.2.4 Needs and Expectations

Stakeholder needs and expectations should be defined in documented information and communicated. The organization should:
- Consider means for traceability of information currency
- Measure service levels delivered by assets
- Determine and record stakeholder perceptions
- Establish clear, documented decision-making criteria influenced by stakeholder needs, asset management policy, and organizational risk attitude

> **Important:** Decision-making criteria should be appropriate to the importance and complexity of decisions. They should be used to evaluate competing options for achieving asset management objectives.

#### 4.2.5 Communication with Stakeholders

- Level of detail varies by stakeholder
- Be aware of legal and regulatory reporting requirements
- Stakeholders should be informed about decisions that may affect them
- Failure to communicate adequately can itself constitute a risk
- Terminology should be consistent with other organizational functions
- Manage communication through registers or matrices (who, what, when, how, why)

### 4.3 Determining the Scope of the Asset Management System

Based on context and stakeholder reviews, the organization should define the boundaries of the system. The scope should:
- a) Consider the range, grouping, process and functional connectivity of assets
- b) Address the relevance of assets for the organization's context and purpose
- c) Identify organizational units, locations and contractual boundaries

Annex B provides further guidance for establishing scope in various situations.

### 4.4 Asset Management System

#### 4.4.1 General

In initial development, the organization should describe how it will establish, implement, operate, maintain and improve the system. Key considerations:

- The system should not be isolated - integrate with other organizational functions (quality, finance, accounting, safety, risk, HR)
- Leverage existing business processes where possible
- Ensure methodologies for managing costs and benefits support appropriate decision-making
- Consider how to prioritize what to develop first
- Initial compliance with ISO 55001 should be the minimum starting point, not the final objective

For small organizations, the organizational plan can be a single document including:
- a) Organizational objectives
- b) The SAMP
- c) Asset management plans

#### 4.4.2 Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP / PEGA)

The SAMP details asset management objectives, explains their relationship to organizational objectives, and provides the framework for achieving them.

The SAMP should:
- Translate organizational objectives into asset management objectives
- Identify and define decision-making criteria and processes
- Guide development of asset management plans

There should be alignment and coherence between:
- Organizational objectives
- Asset management policy
- The SAMP
- Asset management objectives
- Asset management plans

When developing the SAMP, the organization should consider:
- a) Context of the organization
- b) Stakeholder expectations and requirements
- c) Activities extending beyond routine planning schedules
- d) Scope of the asset management system
- e) Available financial, human and other resources
