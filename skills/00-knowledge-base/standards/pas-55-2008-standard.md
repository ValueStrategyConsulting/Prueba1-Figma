## 0. Introduction

### 0.1 What is Asset Management?

Asset management is defined as:

> Systematic and coordinated activities and practices through which an organization optimally and sustainably manages its assets and asset systems, their associated performance, risks and expenditures over their life cycles for the purpose of achieving its organizational strategic plan.

### Key Principles and Attributes

The following principles apply to the design and implementation of an asset management system:
- **Holistic** - looking at the big picture
- **Systematic** - methodical approach
- **Systemic** - dealing with the whole system
- **Risk-based** - prioritized by risk
- **Optimal** - best value compromise
- **Sustainable** - long-term viability
- **Integrated** - linked across functions

### Principal Benefits of Optimized Life Cycle Asset Management

- Enhanced customer satisfaction from improved performance and control
- Improved health, safety and environmental performance
- Optimized return on investment and/or growth
- Long-term planning, confidence and performance sustainability
- Ability to demonstrate best value-for-money within constrained funding
- Evidence of legal, regulatory and statutory compliance
- Improved risk management and corporate governance
- Improved corporate reputation
- Ability to demonstrate sustainable development

### Essential Enabling Elements

- Organizational structure facilitating implementation with clear direction and leadership
- Staff awareness, competency, commitment and cross-functional coordination
- Adequate information and knowledge of asset condition, performance, risks and costs

### 0.2 Types of Assets

Physical assets represent one of five broad categories:
1. **Physical assets** (focus of this PAS)
2. Human assets
3. Information assets
4. Financial assets
5. Intangible assets (reputation, morale, intellectual property, goodwill)

The management of physical assets is inextricably linked to the other categories, but this PAS only considers them where they directly impact physical asset management.

### 0.3 The Need for an Asset Management System

An asset management system supports the delivery of the organizational strategic plan. It provides the optimal combination of life cycle activities across diverse asset systems and assets, accounting for their criticalities, condition, performance and chosen risk profile.

Asset management involves trade-offs between:
- Performance, cost and risk
- Short-term versus long-term benefits
- Expenditures versus performance levels
- Planned and unplanned availability
- Capital costs versus operating expenditures

Assets can be managed at different levels - from discrete equipment items to complex functional systems, networks, sites or diverse portfolios.

### 0.4 The Structure of an Asset Management System

The "line of sight" between organizational strategic direction and day-to-day activities is a vital component. This aligns "top down" aspirations with "bottom up" realities and opportunities.

**Planning elements (top to bottom):**
1. Organizational Strategic Plan (OSP)
2. Asset Management Policy
3. Asset Management Strategy
4. Asset Management Objectives
5. Asset Management Plan(s)

**Implementation elements:**
- Organization values, prioritization criteria and risk policy
- Functional policies, strategies, standards, processes and procedures
- Life cycle activities (Acquire/Create, Utilize, Maintain, Renew/Dispose)
- Portfolio of asset systems and individual assets

### 0.5 Application of PAS 55

This PAS is applicable to:
- Any asset-intensive business where significant expenditure, resources, performance dependency and/or risks are associated with assets
- Any organization managing a significant portfolio of assets
- Organizations with accountability requirements for safe management of assets

The requirements are prescriptive only to the extent that they define **what** has to be done, not **how** to do it.

### 0.6 Integration with Other Management Systems

Follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) framework:

| Phase | Activity |
|---|---|
| **Plan** | Establish asset management strategy, objectives and plans |
| **Do** | Establish enablers, implement asset management plan(s) |
| **Check** | Monitor and measure results against policy, strategy, objectives |
| **Act** | Take actions to achieve objectives and continually improve |

## 1. Scope

- Establish an asset management system to optimally manage physical assets over their life cycles
- Implement, maintain and improve an asset management system
- Assure itself of compliance with its stated policy and strategy
