> **Combination**: 5 of 72
> **Mechanism**: Breaks/Fracture/Separates
> **Cause**: Cyclic loading (thermal/mechanical)
> **Frequency Basis**: Operational
> **Typical Failure Pattern**: B (Age-related) — fatigue damage accumulates progressively with each load cycle; fracture occurs after a predictable number of cycles related to stress amplitude (S-N curve)
> **ISO 14224 Failure Mechanism**: 2.6 Fatigue
> **Weibull Guidance**: β typically 2.5–5.0 (wear-out), η 10⁶–10⁸ cycles depending on stress amplitude, material fatigue limit, surface finish, and stress concentration

## Physical Degradation Process

Fatigue fracture due to cyclic loading is a three-stage progressive failure: crack initiation, stable crack propagation, and sudden final fracture. Stage 1 (initiation) occurs at stress concentration points — notches, keyways, weld toes, corrosion pits, machining marks, or material inclusions — where local stress exceeds the material's fatigue limit even though the nominal stress is well below the yield strength. Micro-cracks nucleate through persistent slip band formation after 10⁴–10⁶ cycles. Stage 2 (propagation) follows Paris' law: the crack grows incrementally with each load cycle, producing characteristic "beach marks" or "clamshell" marks on the fracture surface. Stage 3 (final fracture) occurs suddenly when the remaining cross-section can no longer carry the peak load — the fracture transitions from the smooth fatigue zone to a rough, granular instantaneous fracture zone.

Thermal fatigue follows the same progression but the cyclic stresses are generated by repeated heating and cooling. Temperature gradients across a component create differential expansion that generates cyclic thermal stresses. The thermal strain range (Δε = α × ΔT) determines fatigue life via the Coffin-Manson equation. Thermal fatigue cracks typically initiate on the surface and propagate inward (opposite to mechanical fatigue which can initiate at internal defects).

In OCP phosphate processing, cyclic fatigue is prevalent in: SAG mill and ball mill trunnion shafts subjected to rotational bending (one full stress reversal per revolution at 10–15 RPM — ~5 × 10⁶ cycles per year); vibrating screen side plates and mounting brackets that experience 10⁸+ cycles per year at 900–1200 RPM; pump shafts in slurry service subjected to hydraulic radial loading; conveyor idler shafts with rotational bending; kiln and dryer shell sections experiencing thermal cycling during startup/shutdown (ΔT > 200°C); and piping at expansion loop elbows where thermal expansion creates cyclic bending. The combination of fatigue loading and phosphoric acid corrosion creates corrosion-fatigue — a particularly aggressive mechanism where the fatigue limit is effectively eliminated.

## Detectable Symptoms (P Condition)

- Surface cracks detectable by MPI, DPI, or TOFD at stress concentration points
- Crack growth measurable by periodic NDE (crack length increasing between inspections)
- Vibration amplitude change indicating crack-induced stiffness reduction (sub-harmonic resonance)
- Audible cracking or clicking sounds during load cycling (crack face opening/closing)
- Visible oxide staining (rust weeping) at crack mouths on steel components
- Strain gauge readings showing stress redistribution (adjacent areas taking load from cracked region)
- Ultrasonic testing showing internal crack reflectors (phased array UT for embedded defects)
- Eddy current testing detecting surface/near-surface crack initiation at known hot spots

## Maintenance Strategy Guidance

### Condition-Based (preferred)

- **Primary task**: `Perform MPI on Mill Trunnion Shaft [{tag}]`
- **Acceptable limits**: No crack indications at stress concentration points. For weld toes: no linear indications >3 mm per ASME VIII Div 1 Appendix 6. For shafts: no crack indications at keyways, steps, or bearing seats. Crack growth rate (if monitored) ≤ Paris' law prediction with safety factor ≥2 on remaining life.
- **Conditional comments**: If crack <25% of section: monitor quarterly, engineer repair plan (weld repair, stress relief, or component replacement at next major shutdown). If crack 25–50% of section: schedule repair within 30 days, reduce operating load if possible. If crack >50% of section or growing >1 mm/month: remove from service immediately — final fracture is imminent. Always perform root cause analysis to identify and mitigate the stress concentration or load condition driving fatigue initiation.

### Fixed-Time (for fatigue-limited components)

- **Task**: `Replace vibrating screen side plates on Screen [{tag}]`
- **Interval basis**: Based on design fatigue life calculation per BS 7608 or equivalent, with safety factor ≥4 on calculated life. Typical intervals: vibrating screen structural elements 2–5 years (10⁸–10⁹ cycles at high stress); pump shafts 5–10 years (depending on shaft design and loading); crane runway beams — NDE interval based on BS 7910 fitness-for-service assessment. Weld toe grinding or shot peening to improve fatigue life at critical details.

### Run-to-Failure (applicability criteria)

- **Applicability**: NEVER acceptable for rotating shafts, pressure boundaries, structural load-bearing members, or lifting equipment — sudden fatigue fracture can cause catastrophic secondary failure (mill shell collapse, pump impeller release, crane beam collapse). Acceptable only for non-structural, non-safety elements where fracture causes minor operational disruption and replacement is quick — e.g., conveyor idler shafts (designed for easy replacement).
