## Physical Degradation Process

Degradation due to contamination occurs when foreign particles, water, chemical contaminants, or biological agents infiltrate a system and progressively degrade the properties or performance of the working medium (lubricant, hydraulic fluid, coolant, insulating fluid) or the components themselves. Unlike blockage (FM-02) where contamination causes flow restriction, this mode describes contamination causing material property degradation — the lubricant loses its ability to lubricate, the insulating oil loses its dielectric strength, the coolant loses its corrosion inhibiting properties.

The degradation mechanisms include: abrasive particle contamination in lubricants generating secondary wear particles (contamination-induced wear follows a geometric progression — each wear particle generated by contamination creates more wear particles); water contamination in oil causing hydrogen embrittlement of bearing surfaces, lubricant additive hydrolysis, and formation of corrosive acids; fuel dilution of engine lubricant reducing viscosity below the minimum for hydrodynamic film formation; process fluid contamination of lubricant changing viscosity and chemical properties; and biological contamination of water-based fluids (bacteria produce acids and biofilm that degrade system materials).

The critical concept is that contamination degrades the FLUID which then degrades the COMPONENTS — it's a two-step failure chain where the contamination converts the protective medium into a destructive one. ISO 4406 cleanliness codes are the standard for quantifying particulate contamination in oil and hydraulic fluid.

In OCP phosphate processing, contamination-induced degradation is pervasive: phosphate dust enters lubricant systems through inadequate sealing (dust is highly abrasive, Mohs 5–6); seawater leaks into cooling and lubrication circuits at Jorf Lasfar/Safi; slurry ingress through failed mechanical seals contaminates pump bearing lubricant; moisture condensation in gearbox headspace during temperature cycling; and fuel dilution in diesel engine lubricant on mobile equipment at Khouribga mining operations.

## Detectable Symptoms (P Condition)

- Oil analysis showing particle count exceeding target cleanliness code per ISO 4406
- Water content in oil >200 ppm (or >0.1% for gearbox oils) per ASTM D6304
- Oil viscosity deviating >15% from nominal grade (dilution or contamination)
- Metallic wear debris increasing (ferrography showing cutting/severe wear particles)
- Oil appearance: milky (water), dark (oxidation/soot), hazy (moisture), sparkly (metallic particles)
- Dielectric strength of insulating oil dropping below 30 kV per IEC 60156
- Coolant pH drifting outside specification (biological contamination or inhibitor depletion)
- Bearing vibration increasing in high-frequency band (contamination-induced surface damage)

## Maintenance Strategy Guidance

### Condition-Based (preferred)

- **Primary task**: `Analyze lubricant contamination on Gearbox [{tag}]`
- **Acceptable limits**: Particle count per ISO 4406 target: gearboxes 18/16/13, hydraulic servo valves 16/14/11, bearings 17/15/12. Water content: ≤200 ppm for gearbox and hydraulic oils. Wear metals within statistical control limits (trending within ±2σ). Dielectric strength ≥30 kV for transformer oil per IEC 60156.
- **Conditional comments**: If particle count exceeds target by 2 ISO codes: investigate contamination source, install or upgrade filtration (kidney loop filter for gearboxes, desiccant breather for moisture). If water >500 ppm: drain water from sump (if separation occurs), install coalescing filter or vacuum dehydrator, find and fix water ingress source. If wear metals trending upward: correlate with particle count — if contamination-driven, correct contamination; if machine-driven, investigate bearing/gear condition. If transformer oil dielectric <30 kV: recondition oil (filtration + vacuum degassing) per IEEE C57.106.

### Fixed-Time (for contamination control)

- **Task**: `Replace oil filter on Gearbox [{tag}]`
- **Interval basis**: Oil filters: replace per OEM interval or when ΔP reaches bypass setting (whichever first). Desiccant breathers: replace when color change indicates saturation (typically 3–6 months in humid environments). Coolant: replace per OEM interval, typically 12–24 months (inhibitor depletion). Transformer oil reconditioning: per DGA results, typically every 3–5 years. Implement contamination exclusion as primary strategy: upgrade breathers, improve sealing, maintain filtration, proper oil storage and handling per ISO 4406 target achievement.

### Run-to-Failure (applicability criteria)

- **Applicability**: NEVER acceptable for hydraulic servo systems (contamination causes catastrophic valve failure), transformer oil (dielectric failure causes internal fault), or engine oil (contamination causes accelerated wear). Acceptable only for non-critical, simple lubrication points where oil quantity is small and change is frequent (e.g., small chain drives, open gear lubrication).
