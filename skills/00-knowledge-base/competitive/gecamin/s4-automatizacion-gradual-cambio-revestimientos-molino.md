# Automatizacion Gradual del Cambio de Revestimientos del Molino

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Stephen Gwynn-Jones, Joel Bohorquez, Juan Luque, Claudio Figueroa (RME)
- **Session:** S4 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Progressive automation of mill relining from manual processes to fully automated systems using INSIDEOUT and AutoMotion technologies

## Key Points
- RME defines 6 levels of mill relining optimization, from fully manual (Level 1) to advanced automated with AutoMotion (Level 6)
- Key safety driver: eliminating machine-person interaction inside the mill during liner replacement
- RUSSELL Claw: new tool for removing worn liners without slings, handling liners up to 8 tons, adaptable to all liner types
- INSIDEOUT technology eliminates personnel from inside the mill during liner movements
- AutoMotion adds AI-based automation to reduce personnel intervention both inside and outside the mill
- Case study: Southeast Asian copper mine moved from Level 4 to Level 6
- Conventional wall liner installation ~120 sec average vs. automated ~50 sec average (58% faster)
- Pioneer users targeting 85% risk reduction and 50%+ reduction in relining times vs. historical performance
- Technologies are modular and can be implemented in stages during planned maintenance windows
- Key learnings: cultural and process change required, step-by-step approach recommended, close stakeholder collaboration essential

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Mill relining is one of the most critical planned maintenance activities in concentrator plants, directly impacting mill availability
- Automation reduces relining time by 12-50%, significantly increasing productive hours of the most expensive assets in the plant
- Elimination of personnel from hazardous zones addresses the highest safety risks in plant maintenance
- Modular, staged implementation approach aligns with asset management principles of progressive improvement
- Quality improvements from automated installation reduce risk of premature liner failure and unplanned downtime
