# Desafios de los Motores de Alta Potencia en Mineria - Desarrollo de Tecnologias de Lubricantes

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Gabriel Concha Gutierrez (Copec)
- **Session:** S9 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Development of advanced lubricant technologies for high-power diesel engines in mining (up to 2,700 HP/330-ton trucks), through a tripartite partnership between Copec, ExxonMobil, and OEMs, resulting in a custom lubricant product created in Chile for the world market.

## Key Points
- **The challenge of high-power mining engines:**
  - Modern mining equipment ranges from 180 HP (1-ton) to 2,700 HP (330-ton) trucks.
  - Operating conditions are extreme: high altitude, extreme temperatures, and massive mechanical stress.
  - Crankshaft tangential velocity reaches 464 m/s (1,670 km/hr equivalent), compared to 18 m/s (64 km/hr) at surface speed, illustrating the extreme lubrication demands.
- **OEM requirements for lubricants:**
  1. Lubrication pressure above 60 PSI.
  2. Viscosity at 100C above 14 cSt at maximum operating hours of the oil change frequency.
  3. Wear metal rates within condemnatory limits per site.
  4. All other variables within established client and OEM limits.
- **Critical engine components requiring lubrication protection:**
  - Connecting rod bearings (multi-layer: steel base, overlay, lead-tin/lead-indium coating, oil grooves).
  - Cylinder liners.
  - Crankshaft journals.
  - Pistons.
- **Diagnostic approach:** Forensic inspection, laboratory analysis, and microscopic examination of failed and worn components to understand lubricant performance.
- **Trial methodology - Progressive technology testing:**
  - **Phase 1 (Mineral technology, 600-hr drain):** Two prototype candidates (ALPHA 15W-40 and GAMA 15W-40). Control samples at 20 min, monitoring at 250, 500, 600 hours. Full flushing at start.
  - **Phase 2 (Semi-synthetic technology, 1,000-hr drain):** Two candidates (KAPPA 15W-40 and ZETA 15W-40). Monitoring at 250, 500, 750, 1,000 hours.
  - **Phase 3 (Full synthetic technology, 1,250-hr drain):** Mobil Delvac Ultra 5W-40 Extended Performance Mine. Monitoring at 250, 500, 750, 1,250 hours.
- **Key result:** Lead content in oil dropped to 1.5 ppm maximum (OEM condemning limits: 3.7-5.3 ppm), demonstrating excellent bearing protection.
- **Outcome:** ExxonMobil developed a custom product based on Copec's requirements, with OEM-approved trial protocols. ExxonMobil signed a warranty. Product created "from Chile for the world."
- **Success factors:**
  - Strong OEM relationships (truck = USD 3M, engine alone = USD 1.2M, 2019 basis).
  - Copec TOC team strength (Technical, Operational, Commercial).
  - On-site presence at mining operations.
  - High-level Copec-ExxonMobil executive relationship.
  - Disciplined work and periodic follow-up meetings.
  - Disciplined collaboration between client, suppliers, and Copec.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Lubricant technology is a critical enabler of engine life extension and extended drain intervals, directly impacting total cost of ownership for the most expensive mobile assets in mining.
- The progressive trial methodology (mineral -> semi-synthetic -> synthetic, with increasing drain intervals) is a best-practice approach to validating lubricant changes safely.
- The tripartite partnership model (end user/Copec/ExxonMobil/OEM) demonstrates how collaborative relationships can drive product innovation tailored to extreme operating conditions.
- Lead content in oil at 1.5 ppm vs. 3.7-5.3 ppm limits indicates significant remaining bearing life margin, enabling potential further drain interval extension.
- Engine replacement costs (USD 1.2M) justify substantial investment in lubricant optimization and monitoring.
- The "from Chile for the world" outcome shows how mining-specific demands can drive global product development.
