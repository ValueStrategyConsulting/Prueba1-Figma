# Mejorar Practicas de Apernado: Monitoreo de Tension de Pernos en Aplicaciones de Mineria

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Cory Waxman (Copper State Bolt & Nuts Co. / BoltSense)
- **Session:** S4 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Direct bolt tension monitoring technology (LMF+) to eliminate bolt failures in mining applications

## Key Points
- Case 1: SAG Mill 36' in Ontario, Canada - M48 oval bolts cutting despite various strategies; LMF+ detected grave installation errors; zero unplanned stops since 2022, saving $12M USD in unplanned downtime costs
- Case 2: Ball Mill in Peru - M64 studs; LMF+ detected critical installation errors corrected instantly, preventing flange structural repair
- Root cause of most bolt failures: insufficient tension (not overload as commonly believed)
- Bolt loosening in mining often caused by plastic deformation of surface asperities (embedding), not nut backing off
- LMF+ (Load Monitoring Fastener Plus) provides direct, continuous tension monitoring (not torque-based)
- Torque does not equal tension - this is the fundamental misconception addressed
- Four-step success process: initial torque/tension correction, bolt relaxation compensation, bolt interaction consideration, monitoring and data correlation with events
- Re-torquing should only be done when necessary and at validated levels, considering changing friction factors
- Applications: crushers, pulp pumps, exciters, screens, motor anchors, rock breakers - any critical bolting application
- Common misconceptions corrected: bolt failure is not inevitable, multiple technologies can complement each other

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Bolt failures in mills and other critical mining equipment cause millions in unplanned downtime costs
- Direct tension monitoring enables condition-based bolt maintenance rather than time-based re-torquing
- Technology provides data-driven insights into installation quality, supporting continuous improvement of maintenance practices
- Elimination of unplanned stops from bolt failures directly improves asset availability and OEE
- Integrates with digital maintenance strategies as a continuous monitoring IoT solution
