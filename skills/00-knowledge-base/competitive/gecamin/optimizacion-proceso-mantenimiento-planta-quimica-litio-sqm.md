# Optimizacion del Proceso de Mantenimiento en Planta Quimica de Litio SQM

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Rodrigo Chavez P., Claudio Villalobos A.
- **Session:** S9 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Comprehensive maintenance process optimization at SQM's lithium chemical plant, focusing on work order cleanup, critical line update, KPI rationalization, and planning/scheduling improvement, achieving 54% backlog reduction and 94% plan base alignment.

## Key Points
- **Motivation:** Beyond standard maintenance optimization (preventive, predictive, spares management, training), SQM identified deeper structural questions requiring answers:
  - Are some equipment discontinued? How does this affect work orders, plans, and required materials?
  - Has CAPEX investment in redundancy or repowering changed the preventive/corrective work order mix?
  - Has updated decision matrix and critical route changed predictive plans and maintenance response?
- **Focus of improvement:** A full update, cleanup, and restructuring of the maintenance process was needed, not just incremental optimization.
- **Impact areas of improved information and processes:**
  - **Internal Resource Management:** Fewer work orders, updated critical line, RCM-based strategy leading to better backlog control and resource allocation to value-adding activities.
  - **Decision Making:** Better and more timely information for budget/cost control, basis for future expansion/improvement projects, KPI-driven focus on what matters, unified communication ("everyone speaks the same language").
  - **Supply Chain Integration:** Lower maintenance-related inventory, better balanced CAPEX and asset base, improved MRP processes, reduced stockouts and overstock.
- **Metrics framework - 7 indicators (3 result + 4 performance):**
  - **Result indicators:** Cost reduction (5% target), Availability (+1 pp target), Inventory level (-30% target).
  - **Performance indicators:** Work order completeness (80% target), Rework rate (2% target), Backlog (4 weeks target), Equipment with calculated MTBF (>90% target).
- **Diagnostic findings:**
  - No control or traceability of maintenance programs.
  - Critical line not updated.
  - Perception of scheduled activities with no added value.
  - Work plan deviations far from reality.
  - Lack of understanding of reportability value (data quality).
  - ~80 KPIs existed, ~30% measured the same thing with different names; no comprehension or value from these.
- **Action plan - Planning:**
  - Reviewed planning-scheduling-execution workflow.
  - Reviewed maintenance engineering processes.
  - Analyzed ERP (Maximo) data via queries, compliance reports, schedule effectiveness, cash cost (maintenance spend vs. availability), HH reporting deviations.
- **Action plan - Engineering:**
  - Updated critical line to 100% coverage.
  - Reviewed and validated maintenance plans (MP) by equipment family.
  - QPA framework (Quality, Performance, Availability) for maintenance engineering.
- **Plan base alignment:** Improved from 61% coincidence between Maximo and plan base to 94% coincidence.
- **Work plan accuracy:** Found high percentage of work plans with >20% deviation between planned HH and actual HH; initiated field confirmation process.
- **Training plan:** Developed internally-led capability building program.
- **Results achieved:**
  - **54% backlog reduction.**
  - Optimization of available HH resources.
  - Updated critical line, active assets, and real MTBF calculation.
  - Control and traceability of failures associated with production impact and budget.
- **Behavioral improvements observed:**
  - Increased personnel involvement and commitment to reportability.
  - Better program compliance adherence.
  - Self-demanding performance standards.
  - Improved cross-functional communication.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- This is a textbook example of maintenance process maturation: cleaning up the data foundation, rationalizing KPIs, updating asset registers, and improving planning accuracy before attempting advanced optimization.
- The reduction from ~80 KPIs (30% redundant) to a focused set of 7 demonstrates the principle that fewer, well-understood metrics drive better decisions than many confusing ones.
- The 61% to 94% plan base alignment improvement shows the critical importance of data hygiene in ERP/CMMS systems.
- The 54% backlog reduction is a strong leading indicator of improved maintenance execution and resource utilization.
- The approach is directly transferable to any process plant using Maximo or similar CMMS that has accumulated technical debt in its maintenance data.
- The human factors outcomes (engagement, communication, self-demanding standards) demonstrate that process optimization drives cultural improvement.
