# Estudio de Fuerza Laboral de la Gran Mineria Chilena 2023-2032: Proyeccion Laboral para Mantenedores

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Veronica Cid, Pio Marshall, Vladimir Glasinovic, Camila Silva (Alianza CCM-Eleva, Fundacion Chile / Consejo Minero)
- **Session:** S16 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Workforce study projecting labor demand for maintenance roles in Chilean large-scale mining through 2032, identifying critical quantitative, qualitative, and skills update challenges.

## Key Points
- **CCM-Eleva Alliance** (Mining Competency Council + Eleva Program) has over 10 years connecting the mining industry with the education/training sector, supported by Fundacion Chile and Consejo Minero
- **Total universe:** 238,000 workers in Chilean large-scale mining
- **Maintenance profiles will concentrate 55% of labor demand by 2032** -- the single largest occupational group
- **Three critical challenges identified:**
  1. **Quantitative challenge:**
     - High demand (55% of total demand by 2032)
     - Shortage of people with technical competencies (58% gap) and experience (56% gap)
     - **Deficit of 8,876 maintenance workers by 2032**
  2. **Qualitative challenge -- Gender inclusion:**
     - Only 6% female maintainers in mining companies
     - Only 3% female maintainers in supplier/contractor companies
     - Significant need to attract more women to maintenance roles
  3. **Skills update challenge:**
     - Insufficient digital competencies in current maintenance worker training
     - Gap in the supply of maintainers with required technical competencies
     - Technology will have a high impact on maintenance roles
- **Technology impact:** HR survey respondents from mining and supplier companies indicate technologies will significantly transform maintenance jobs, requiring new digital skills
- **Local employment** analysis by occupational group across the main value chain (mining companies vs. suppliers) for 2020-2022 period

## Relevance to Asset Management
- The projected deficit of nearly 9,000 maintenance workers by 2032 is a critical risk to asset management capacity in Chilean mining
- This workforce gap drives the urgency for automation, AI, remote monitoring, and other technologies that can augment limited maintenance staff
- The digital skills gap means that even current maintenance workers need upskilling to work with modern asset management tools (CMMS, IoT, predictive analytics)
- Gender diversity in maintenance is both a social imperative and a practical solution to the worker shortage
- For asset management software companies, this data validates the market need for tools that increase maintainer productivity and reduce dependency on scarce skilled labor
- The 55% demand concentration in maintenance roles confirms that maintenance workforce planning is the most critical HR challenge in Chilean mining
