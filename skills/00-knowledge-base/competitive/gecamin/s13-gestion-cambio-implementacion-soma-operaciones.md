# Gestion del Cambio en la Implementacion del SOMA desde el Rol de Operaciones

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Carlo Lobiano, Nolberto Vega, Alvaro Lenis (CODELCO - Division El Teniente)
- **Session:** S13 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Change management implementation of CODELCO's Maintenance Operating System (SOMA) from the operations perspective using Kotter's 8-step model

## Key Points
- Division El Teniente: panel caving underground mine, 150,000 tpd, fleet of 70 LHDs (manual and autonomous)
- Mina Norte: 60,000 tpd with 30 LHDs, 12 CAEX, and 42 rock breakers
- SOMA (Sistema Operativo de Mantenimiento): CODELCO's standard maintenance operating system for optimizing maintenance management across the asset lifecycle
- Challenge: organizational change and new system implementation generates uncertainty and adaptation difficulties
- Initial diagnosis: only 10% of operational staff understood SOMA; 60% of professional staff understood it
- Hypothesis: "Greater understanding of the system's purpose and value capture should generate greater involvement and collaborative value creation"
- Applied Kotter's 8-step change management model:
  1. Create urgency: shared availability, utilization, and failure Pareto data with operators and maintainers
  2. Build change coalition: trained unit leaders, workshop managers, shift bosses, and coordinators
  3. Establish strategic vision: improve SOMA implementation through cultural change and team dynamics
  4. Recruit change leaders: 60 extraction operators, 20 maintainers, 20 shift bosses, 8 process managers
  5. Eliminate barriers: replaced confrontation with collaboration, organized meeting agendas, validated inclusive opinions
  6. Short-term wins: hydraulic leak improvement from joint prioritization, modified check lists, EQAC reduction
  7. Sustain change: process confirmations and role confirmations from C+ management system
  8. Make change habitual: 100% SOMA cycle compliance in operations at Mina Norte
- Results: 10% improvement in global LHD availability, 34% decrease in EQAC equipment downtime hours, 21% decrease in hydraulic leak downtime hours
- Survey conducted in September confirmed substantial improvement in participation quality and commitment compliance

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates that maintenance system success depends as much on change management as on technical design
- Operations involvement in maintenance is critical: operators are the first line of equipment condition detection
- Kotter's model provides a structured, replicable framework for implementing maintenance operating systems
- Measurable results (10% availability improvement, 34% EQAC reduction) validate the change management investment
- Applicable to any organization implementing new maintenance management systems or ISO 55000 frameworks
