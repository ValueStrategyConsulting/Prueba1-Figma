# DigiFex 2.0 - Innovacion en la Excitacion de Campo para Motores Sincronos

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Alejandra Guerra, Eric Martinez, Pablo Garcia, Rommel Villarreal (AMI Automation)
- **Session:** S8 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Introduction of DigiFEX 2.0, a digital field excitation system for synchronous motors in mining applications (mills, compressors), featuring embedded single-board technology, high-speed diagnostics, and SmartDisplay HMI for improved motor protection and monitoring.

## Key Points
- **AMI Automation:** Power conversion OEM and system integrator with 35+ years of experience, part of Resonac, with 20-year JV with GE and partnership with TMEIC (Toshiba-Mitsubishi). Top 3 largest system integrators in the Americas.
- **Problem with existing excitation technology:**
  - Poor information exchange between systems.
  - Difficult to achieve reliable diagnostics due to lack of tools.
  - Lack of high-speed graphs and trends for analysis.
- **Synchronous motor types supported:**
  - DC Brushless (most common in mining mills).
  - DC Collector/Slip Ring.
  - AC Brushless.
- **Motor applications:** Single pinion and dual pinion mills, compressors, and other large synchronous motor-driven loads.
- **DigiFEX product family:** Three main configurations designed for different motor types and applications, each engineered for specific protection requirements.
- **DigiFEX 2.0 features:**
  - **Embedded SingleBoard Technology:** Compact, integrated design replacing multi-component legacy systems.
  - **SmartDisplay HMI:** On-screen real-time trends for field current, induced voltage, armature voltage, firing angle.
  - **High-speed diagnostics:** Capture of startup sequence, field application, crowbar test, and normal operation with high-resolution trending.
  - **Multiple regulation modes:**
    1. Field Current regulation.
    2. Power Factor regulation.
    3. VAR Reactive Power regulation.
    4. Hybrid (application-specific).
  - **Starting methods supported:** Across-the-line, Reactor, Auto-transformer, Soft-starter, VFD.
  - **Comprehensive protections:**
    - Pull-out protection.
    - Over/under field current.
    - Stall detection (speed sensor option).
    - Consecutive starts monitoring.
    - Field current tracking.
    - RTD monitoring (optional).
    - On-screen ready/run permissives.
    - Self-test program.
    - Starting sequence monitoring.
    - Diode shorted/open detection.
  - **Testing capabilities:** Crowbar test evaluation, field excitation tests, sequence simulation tests.
  - **Communication:** AXIO protocol for integration with plant control systems.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Synchronous motors are among the most critical and expensive assets in mining concentrators (mill drives, large compressors); their excitation system reliability directly affects plant availability.
- The high-speed diagnostic capability enables condition-based maintenance of excitation systems, moving beyond calendar-based field coil inspections.
- Multiple regulation modes (power factor, VAR, hybrid) allow optimization of motor performance and energy efficiency.
- The comprehensive protection suite reduces the risk of catastrophic motor failure from excitation-related faults.
- Upgrading legacy excitation systems to DigiFEX extends the useful life of existing synchronous motors, deferring capital replacement.
- The SmartDisplay HMI democratizes diagnostic information, enabling maintenance technicians to troubleshoot excitation issues without specialized instrumentation.
