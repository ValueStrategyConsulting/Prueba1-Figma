# Analisis de la Eficiencia Productiva en la Maquinaria Pesada de Operaciones Mineras

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Juan Carlos Latorre Boza
- **Session:** S16 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Framework for analyzing and estimating productive efficiency of heavy mining machinery, identifying six key factors and their weighted impact on hourly production rates.

## Key Points
- **Hourly production formula:** Q = (q x 60 / Cm) x E, where Q = hourly production (m3/hr), q = production per cycle, Cm = cycle duration, E = work efficiency
- Work efficiency is one of the most complex elements to estimate for hourly production; it depends on topography, operator skill, machine selection, and work distribution
- **User survey findings:**
  - 60% of respondents do not calculate hourly production in operations
  - Among those who do not use efficiency, reasons include: not knowing how to estimate it, using standard calculations, or not understanding its effect
- **Six selected efficiency factors with assigned weights:**
  1. **Precipitation incidence (23%)** -- Highest impact factor
  2. **Operator training and experience (21%)** -- Second highest impact
  3. **Altitude (17%)** -- Significant in high-altitude Chilean mining
  4. **Mechanical availability (15%)**
  5. **Road condition (13%)**
  6. **Ambient temperature (11%)** -- Lowest impact
- **Efficiency benchmarks by factor:**
  - Altitude: 83% at sea level down to 52% above 4,500 masl
  - Operator training: 47% (low) to 83% (advanced with technology assistance)
  - Mechanical availability: 83% (90-95%) down to 58% (<75%)
  - Road condition: 83% (excellent) to 61% (poor)
  - Precipitation: 83% (dry) to 42% (intense rain)
  - Temperature: 83% (10-30C) down to 62% (-10 to 0C)
- **Simulation case studies:**
  - Mine at 4,120 masl with 218-ton trucks, 85% availability: efficiency varies monthly with precipitation
  - Mine at 4,861 masl with 218-ton trucks, 80% availability: lower baseline efficiency due to extreme altitude
- **Key conclusions:** Precipitation and operator training have the greatest impact on efficiency; road condition and temperature have the least

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Provides a quantitative framework for estimating equipment productivity that accounts for real operating conditions rather than catalog specifications
- The factor weighting system allows maintenance and operations teams to prioritize improvement efforts (e.g., operator training yields more benefit than road improvements)
- Mechanical availability is shown as just one of six factors affecting productivity -- a reminder that maintenance alone cannot maximize output
- Altitude-adjusted efficiency is critical for Chilean and Peruvian high-altitude mining operations
- Helps bridge the gap between maintenance KPIs (availability) and production outcomes (actual tonnes moved)
- Useful for fleet sizing, production planning, and setting realistic performance targets
