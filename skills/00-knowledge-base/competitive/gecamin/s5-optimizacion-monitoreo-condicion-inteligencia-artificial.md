# Optimizacion del Analisis de Monitoreo de Condicion mediante Inteligencia Artificial

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Patricio Ortiz, Cristobal Perez, Pedro Cancino (Coddi.ai)
- **Session:** S5 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** AI-powered SaaS platform for condition monitoring analysis that reduced report time by 56% and increased throughput by 77%

## Key Points
- Coddi.ai is a startup / spin-off from a condition monitoring laboratory, offering Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Traditional condition monitoring challenges: difficult to maintain software, long learning curve, many man-hours to implement, slow improvements with little impact
- Classic software relied on decision-tree models with manual text reports and limited field declarations
- Solution: software that learns and evolves, simple to maintain, unified text fields, and applied AI
- Three main implementation challenges: measuring impact, change management, and comment validation
- Before software: 3,990 reports at 8.3 min average; with classic software: 5,040 reports at 6.1 min average
- With AI software: 7,050 reports at 3.7 min average - a 56% reduction in time per report and 77% increase in report volume
- Change management key principle: "Empower specialists' work, not replace it"
- Comment validation through 4 iterations with 90% accuracy achieved, using both internal team and client feedback
- Results: improved efficiency, rapid adoption, knowledge management continuity, and diagnostic continuity
- New services being developed: condition monitoring alerts, inspections, operational variable integration, alarm generation, speech-to-text models

## Relevance to Asset Management
- AI-assisted condition monitoring dramatically increases the capacity of reliability teams without proportional headcount increases
- 56% reduction in analysis time enables earlier detection and response to developing failure modes
- Standardized AI-generated reports improve consistency and reduce dependency on individual analyst expertise
- Knowledge management continuity addresses the critical challenge of retaining institutional expertise
- Platform approach (SaaS) makes advanced condition monitoring AI accessible to organizations of all sizes
