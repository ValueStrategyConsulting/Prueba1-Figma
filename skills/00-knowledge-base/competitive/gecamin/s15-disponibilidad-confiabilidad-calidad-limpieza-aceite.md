# Disponibilidad y Confiabilidad en Equipos Criticos a traves de la Calidad y Limpieza del Aceite

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Cesar Llana, Alvaro Alvarado, Enzo Ferrari (C.C.JENSEN / CJC)
- **Session:** S15 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Improving availability and reliability of critical mining equipment through advanced oil filtration and cleanliness management, with case studies demonstrating significant cost savings and downtime reduction.

## Key Points
- **Core problem:** SAG mill lubrication systems have high particulate and water content, causing unplanned shutdowns at USD 80,000/hour
- **80% of system failures are caused by oil contamination** (particulate, water, wear debris)
- **Four main contamination challenges:**
  1. Particulate ingress in crushers and mills (solid particles, pulp)
  2. Unexpected water ingress from heat exchangers or pulp
  3. Component wear debris (accelerated and natural)
  4. Inadequate tank and line flushing
- **ISO 4406 cleanliness codes** define target ranges for different equipment types (engines, hydraulics, gearboxes, bearings, turbine oils, diesel)
- **Case Study 1 - Gyratory Crusher (Fuller-Traylor):**
  - Problem: High particulate requiring oil changes every 2 months with 8-hour production stops
  - Solution: CJC MHDU 427/108 offline filters
  - Results: 150 kg particulate removed bimonthly, 87% less downtime, 83% less oil consumed, USD 459,600 saved annually
- **Case Study 2 - Symons 7' Crusher:**
  - Parallel test: Crusher 4 with CJC vs. Crusher 3 without
  - Results: 86% oil savings, 73% in-line filter savings, 62% mechanical spare parts savings, 66% total cost savings
- **Case Study 3 - Ball Mill emulsion removal:**
  - Problem: Unexpected water ingress from broken heat exchanger caused oil emulsion in 4,500L tank
  - Solution: CJC Desorber D40 for online emulsion removal (8 liters/hour water removal)
  - Result: Delayed mill shutdown by 32 hours until heat exchanger could be repaired
- **Case Study 4 - Traction motors:**
  - Reduced 5 ISO cleanliness codes in 50 minutes of operation (from 21/21/18 to 16/14/11)
- **CJC filter capacity:** 0.8-3 micron single-mesh filtration; 4 kg particulate, 2 liters water, 2 kg varnish per element; 32 different compositions for viscosities 10-1000 cSt

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Oil contamination is a root cause of most hydraulic and lubrication system failures in mining -- addressing this directly improves MTBF and MTTR
- The economic case is strong: USD 80,000/hour downtime cost vs. relatively low investment in offline filtration
- Offline filtration can be implemented without stopping equipment, making it a non-intrusive reliability improvement
- ISO 4406 provides a universal framework for setting cleanliness targets and measuring improvement
- The ball mill emulsion case demonstrates how oil management can provide operational flexibility during emergencies
- Applicable across all mining equipment with lubrication systems: crushers, mills, trucks, conveyors
