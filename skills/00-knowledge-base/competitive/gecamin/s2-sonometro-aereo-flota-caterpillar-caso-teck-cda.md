# Sonometro Aereo para Flota Caterpillar: Caso Mina Teck Carmen de Andacollo

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Arturo Casanga Cortes (Asset Health Engineer, Teck Carmen de Andacollo)
- **Session:** S2 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Implementation of an acoustic imaging camera (aerial sonometer/FLIR Si124) to detect pneumatic system air leaks in aging Caterpillar 789C mining trucks, reducing unplanned downtime from 11 hours to zero at Teck's Carmen de Andacollo copper mine.

## Key Points
- **Company context:** Teck Resources, Canada's largest diversified resource company, operates Carmen de Andacollo (CDA) in the Coquimbo Region, Chile -- an open pit copper mine with 90% Teck ownership producing copper concentrate
- **Problem statement:** The Caterpillar 789C truck fleet at CDA has exceeded 100,000 operating hours; the pneumatic (air) systems present recurrent failures and air leaks that are difficult to diagnose even for experienced maintainers
- Air compressor system is critical because starter motors depend on compressed air; failures caused unplanned stoppages of up to 11 hours per event
- **Project objective:** Find a market-available tool capable of precisely diagnosing and identifying exact air leak locations that is easy to use and quick to implement for both predictive technicians and field maintainers
- **Solution selected:** Acoustic imaging camera (Sonometro Aereo / FLIR Si124) -- uses high-sensitivity microphones to capture and visualize air leaks in real time on a display screen
- **How it measures:** Measures sound in decibels (dB) and vibrations in pneumatic systems, identifying air leaks through acoustic frequencies; provides additional acoustic parameters for equipment operational status analysis
- **Implementation process followed a structured timeline:** Context/Problem -> Objective -> Solution -> How it measures -> Training -> Fleet implementation -> Testing in other areas -> Benefits and conclusions
- **Training:** Internal instructional guide developed by the reliability department; well received by maintainers who adopted the technology to prevent failures and report leaks immediately
- **Fleet implementation:** Successfully deployed across Caterpillar 789C fleet at CDA, with field images showing technicians using FLIR devices in engine compartments to pinpoint leak locations
- **Results and benefits:**
  1. Pneumatic start failures reduced to zero -- significantly improved equipment availability
  2. Maintenance cost savings through reduced corrective interventions via early leak detection
  3. Greater operational reliability -- fleet operates with higher continuity and lower failure risk
  4. Extended component useful life through predictive monitoring
  5. MTBF improved significantly through 2023, with air system failure time dropping from 61.8 hours (February peak) to 0 hours by November-December 2023
- **Expansion to other areas:** Successfully tested in the flotation plant for detecting leaks in piping systems and flanged connections
- **Conclusions:**
  1. Operational improvement: Significant reduction in pneumatic system downtime
  2. Technological innovation: Precise leak detection improved maintenance team efficiency and built new workforce competencies
  3. Resource optimization: Reduced unplanned events allow maintenance team to focus on scheduled (more productive) work
  4. Sustainability: Aligned with Teck values, contributing to efficient energy use

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates a low-cost, high-impact condition monitoring technology (acoustic imaging) that can be integrated into asset health management strategies for aging equipment fleets
- The MTBF improvement data (zero pneumatic failures after implementation) provides compelling evidence for the business case of predictive maintenance technology investments
- The structured implementation methodology (problem identification -> solution -> training -> deployment -> expansion) is a replicable model for condition monitoring technology adoption
- Shows how predictive maintenance tools shift maintenance teams from reactive/corrective work to productive scheduled work -- a key value proposition for asset management software
- Cross-area applicability (trucks to flotation plant) demonstrates how a single condition monitoring investment can scale across multiple asset types
- Teck (major mining company) as an adopter validates acoustic imaging as a mainstream maintenance technology for the mining industry
