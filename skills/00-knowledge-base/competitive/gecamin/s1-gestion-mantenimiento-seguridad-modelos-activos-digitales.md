# Gestion de Mantenimiento y Seguridad mediante Modelos de Activos Digitales

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Nicolas Luders (Hexagon)
- **Session:** S1 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** How digital asset models (BIM, GIS, point clouds) integrated with EAM/APM systems transform maintenance management and safety in mining operations.

## Key Points
- Traditional asset structures in management systems (EAM/CMMS) are hierarchical: Location > Systems > Position > Asset > Linear Asset
- Traditional structures have advantages: simplicity, roll-up capabilities, meter management, rotation traceability
- Traditional structures have critical limitations: limited representation of reality, low integration with other systems, slow decision-making, reduced management capacity
- Digital asset models leverage four resource categories: Information (design, project, construction, operation data), Processing (cloud, datalake, AI), Systems (SCADA, BMS, EAM, APM), and Devices (smartphones, AR goggles, GPS, drones, robots)
- The path to digital models includes: CAD/BIM, GIS, Point Clouds, and document integration
- Key use cases demonstrated:
  - **BIM + Point Cloud + DWG**: Interactive 3D navigation of plant assets with tagged equipment linked to EAM data
  - **CAD+BIM for Safety (Work Permits/LOTO)**: Visual lockout/tagout management on 3D and 2D plant models, showing hot/cold permit types, isolation points, and work order details directly on engineering drawings
  - **GIS + EAM**: Linear asset management with condition index, criticality index, and risk priority index displayed on maps; mobile field access
  - **PDF for Spare Parts**: Interactive technical drawings linked to material lists within work orders
  - **DWG Asset Structure Updates**: Bidirectional synchronization between CAD drawings and EAM asset hierarchies (associate, validate, check, insert/update)
  - **GIS + BIM with VR/AR**: Field workers using augmented reality for operations and maintenance
  - **BIM for Asset Performance Management**: Risk matrices and 3D visualization of equipment health status
- Maintenance evolution model presented (1.0 through 5.0):
  - 1.0 (CMMS): Reactive run-to-failure
  - 2.0 (CMMS+EAM): Calendar-based preventive maintenance
  - 3.0 (EAM): Condition-based with sensor monitoring and alerts
  - 4.0 (EAM+APM): Predictive/prescriptive with ML algorithms
  - 5.0 (Sustainability & Autonomy): Robotics, smart machines, IoT, big data for autonomous sustainable operations
- Benefits of digital models: Efficiency, Productivity, Sustainability, Quality, Safety

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Directly demonstrates how next-generation asset management software must integrate digital models (BIM, GIS, point clouds) with traditional EAM hierarchies
- The LOTO/work permit use case is a compelling safety application that bridges digital twins with daily maintenance operations
- The maintenance evolution model (1.0 to 5.0) provides a roadmap for software feature development from basic CMMS to autonomous maintenance
- Hexagon (author's company) is a key competitor/partner in the digital asset management space
- The bidirectional CAD-to-EAM synchronization addresses a common pain point in keeping asset registers current
