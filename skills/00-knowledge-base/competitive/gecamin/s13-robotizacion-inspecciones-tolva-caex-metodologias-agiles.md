# Robotizacion de Inspecciones de Tolva CAEX a traves de Desarrollo con Metodologias Agiles

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Eduardo Jopia Fernandez
- **Session:** S13 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Development of a robotic rover for automated haul truck body inspections using agile (Scrum) development methodology

## Key Points
- Problem: personnel exposure to height during manual haul truck body inspections; structural fissures from lack of inspections
- High ratio of unplanned vs. programmed maintenance indicates need for better inspection coverage
- Proposition of value addresses three pillars: safety, reliability, and productivity
- Innovation approach: robotics chosen over traditional task force solutions
- Agile methodology (Scrum) selected for rapid iterative development in short sprints with continuous pivoting
- Lean tools integrated with agile approach for continuous improvement
- Team structure: Centinela leader, Robomotic leader, and development team following Scrum methodology
- Three-sprint development cycle:
  - Sprint 1: Assembly and remote communication, mechanization and mobility testing
  - Sprint 2: New test scenarios and environment changes
  - Sprint 3: Final mobility tests, autonomy adjustments, and measurement calibration
- Rover Inspector Centinela: custom-built robot for navigating haul truck body interior
- Communication system delivers inspection results and reports remotely
- Development shows clear evolution across sprints with redesign, adjustments, and functionality improvements
- Eliminates need for personnel to enter or climb haul truck bodies for structural inspections
- Currently in continued development phase with plans for expanded deployment

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Robotic inspection eliminates one of the highest-risk routine maintenance activities (working at height)
- Improved inspection coverage directly addresses the root cause of unplanned structural failures in haul trucks
- Agile development methodology enables rapid, cost-effective innovation in maintenance technology
- In-house development approach (vs. purchasing commercial solutions) provides customization for specific fleet needs
- Increased inspection frequency and quality improve structural integrity management of the haul truck fleet
