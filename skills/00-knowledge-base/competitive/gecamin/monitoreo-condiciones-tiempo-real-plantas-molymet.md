# Monitoreo de Condiciones en Tiempo Real en Plantas de MolymetNos

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Gonzalo Saldano Vargas
- **Session:** S7 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Journey of implementing real-time condition monitoring at Molymet (molybdenum processing plants), from criticality analysis through strategy definition to full deployment, demonstrating significant cost avoidance.

## Key Points
- Molymet is a major molybdenum processor; the presentation covers their condition monitoring (MonCon) evolution from 2018 to 2024.
- The implementation followed a structured 4-step approach:
  1. **Analysis of Criticality:** Identify which assets warrant monitoring investment.
  2. **Strategy Definition:** Determine the appropriate monitoring strategy per asset.
  3. **Failure Mode Definition:** Identify which failure modes to target with monitoring.
  4. **Implementation:** Deploy monitoring technology and processes.
- **Case Study 1 - Motor bearing failure detection:**
  - Detected bearing outer race fault (BPFO) on electric motor of fan K-130, WS2 on February 24, 2022.
  - Direct maintenance cost: USD 22,500.
  - Production loss (actual): USD 57,200.
  - If undetected, estimated cost: USD 365,800 (motor alone) or USD 610,500 (including Furnace No. 5 production loss).
  - **Savings: 87%** compared to undetected failure scenario.
- **Case Study 2 - Another detection:**
  - Estimated cost if undetected: USD 240,000.
  - **Savings: 50%** through early detection.
- The progression from 2018 to 2024 shows maturation of the condition monitoring program with expanding coverage and increasing value capture.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates the classic business case for condition monitoring: early fault detection dramatically reduces both direct repair costs and consequential production losses.
- The structured approach (criticality -> strategy -> failure modes -> implementation) is a textbook PAS 55/ISO 55000 methodology for deploying condition-based maintenance.
- The 87% savings case is a compelling ROI example for justifying condition monitoring investment in process plants.
- Applicable to any continuous process operation where unplanned downtime has high consequential costs.
- Highlights the importance of vibration analysis as a foundational predictive maintenance technique.
