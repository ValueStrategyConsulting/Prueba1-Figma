- **Topic:** Fretting fatigue analysis and damage modeling in bolted flange joints of ball mills and SAG mills

## Key Points
- Flange cracking occurs preferentially on the discharge side of mills and can significantly shorten asset life
- Crack initiation can appear from 12 months to 5+ years of operation
- Rapid crack propagation: can reach 1 meter or more along the shell in 15-18 months
- Failures force shutdowns for weld repair and often require replacing 50% or more of the structure
- Bolted plate joint fatigue tests conducted at various stress levels (80-220 MPa) and torque levels (5-8 Nm)
- FEM (Finite Element Method) simulation implemented with a damage model to evaluate flange behavior
- Fretting Fatigue Damage (FFD) parameter developed to quantify damage at the flange interface
- FFD analysis shows the region of greatest susceptibility to fretting damage on the flange
- Bolt preload level is a critical variable: different preload percentages produce different FFD distributions
- In-line fretting damage measurement system developed for continuous monitoring
- Damage model has three zones: FFD_min, FFD_crit, and FFD_max for element wear assessment
- NDT findings confirm defects compatible with early-stage cracks in the flange joint zone

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Flange cracking is one of the most expensive failure modes for mill assets, potentially requiring major structural replacement
- The FFD damage model enables predictive assessment of remaining flange life based on operating conditions
- Continuous in-line monitoring of fretting fatigue damage supports condition-based maintenance decisions
- Bolt preload management is identified as a key controllable variable for extending flange service life
- Integration of FEM analysis with field measurements provides a comprehensive approach to structural integrity management
