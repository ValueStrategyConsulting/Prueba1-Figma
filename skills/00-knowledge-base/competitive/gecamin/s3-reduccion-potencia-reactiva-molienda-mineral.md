## Metadata
- **Authors:** Stefan Smits, Cristhian Olivares, Pablo Astudillo, Alfonso Munoz (Innomotics - Siemens)
- **Session:** S3 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** New control mode for cycloconverters in Gearless Mill Drives to reduce reactive power demand by up to 30%

## Key Points
- Cycloconverters from Innomotics (formerly Siemens) are used for speed control of high-power synchronous motors in mineral grinding (Gearless Mill Drives)
- Converter design uses 12-pulse thyristor bridges, offering high availability and overload capacity for mill startup at full load
- Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) real-time simulation developed for detailed evaluation of drive system control and grid requirements
- New control initiative manipulates the motor star point voltage to minimize the firing angle on the dominant phase
- The dynamic control is tested first in HiL simulation using mining-specific software, then validated on real Gearless Mill Drive systems
- Results: up to 30% reduction in reactive power requirements at low speed
- Reduced line current leads to lower resulting voltage drop
- 11th and 13th harmonics at nominal speed significantly reduced
- Lower apparent power demand improves grid stability
- Applicable to existing cycloconverter installations as a control software upgrade

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Reduced reactive power demand directly lowers energy costs for grinding operations, one of the most energy-intensive processes in mining
- Improved grid stability reduces electrical stress on power system assets and extends their service life
- Harmonic reduction decreases thermal stress on transformers and cables, improving reliability
- Software-based improvement (no hardware changes) represents high ROI for existing Gearless Mill Drive installations
- Contributes to sustainability goals through reduced energy consumption per ton of ore processed
