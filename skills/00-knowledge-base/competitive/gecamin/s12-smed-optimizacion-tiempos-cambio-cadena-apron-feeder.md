## Metadata
- **Authors:** Alexsis Rivera Acuna, Luis Hernandez Flores (Compania Minera Zaldivar - Antofagasta Minerals)
- **Session:** S12 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Application of SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) lean methodology to reduce apron feeder chain replacement time from 11 to 8.3 days

## Key Points
- Minera Zaldivar: open-pit copper mine (SX-EW), 50% Antofagasta Minerals / 50% Barrick, 29+ years of operation
- Apron Feeder receives material from haul truck dump hopper and feeds the primary crusher; chain replacement every 3 years
- Historical chain replacement duration: 11 days (2019 and 2021), creating 3-day critical path beyond the 8-day stacker bridge shifting window
- SMED 6-step methodology: measure baseline, classify internal/external activities, convert internal to external, standardize, eliminate internal waste, eliminate external waste
- Internal activities: performed with equipment stopped; External activities: can be done while equipment operates
- Key improvement actions identified:
  - Reduced chain segments from 7 to 5
  - 24/7 electrical support during the task
  - Coordinated transport to avoid delays
  - Effective shift handover (hand-to-hand)
  - Reduced access barrier waiting time
  - Upgraded crane capacity (200 to 350 ton upper deck; 350 to 450 ton lower deck)
  - Parallelization of activities and rapid-change techniques
- Standardized plan reduced from 253 hours baseline to 212.25 hours (planned), 8.8 days target
- Actual 2024 execution: 8.3 days - exceeding the 8.8-day aspiration (24.5% reduction vs. 20% target)
- Implementation requires cross-functional team: reliability, planning, execution, operations, procurement, contractors
- Sustainability through standardized new task procedure, confirmation of process audits, and change management

## Relevance to Asset Management
- SMED lean methodology demonstrated effective for long-duration mining maintenance tasks, not just manufacturing
- Transforming critical path maintenance into non-critical path directly increases plant availability
- Cross-functional team approach and standardized procedures ensure improvements sustain beyond initial implementation
- Crane capacity upgrade investment justified by consistent reduction in plant downtime
- Methodology is transferable to other long-duration maintenance activities in mining operations
