# Simulador con IA, RX y Gemelo Digital para Mejorar la Valuación de Conductores

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Jose Nayhua, Jorge Medina
- **Session:** S3 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Integration of AI, X-ray and digital twin technologies for mining vehicle driver assessment and training

## Key Points
- Addresses the problem of work accidents in mining related to driver behavior and competency
- Applies Edgar Dale's learning pyramid to co-create a technology-based training solution
- Integrates multiple technologies: AI for condition monitoring, XR (extended reality) for equipment inspection, and driving simulators
- AI component manages condition administration, detects unforeseen events, and evaluates driver behavior
- Real-time monitoring of driver performance with pattern recognition and immediate feedback
- Defensive driving simulator integrated with AI evaluation capabilities
- XR technology used for equipment inspection training
- Results show significant adoption: 24,144 uses in 2019 growing to 291 uses across categories by 2024
- Demonstrated measurable improvement in driver assessment quality and reduction in incidents
- Benefits include reduced accident rates, better driver competency evaluation, and standardized training

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Driver behavior directly impacts equipment life and maintenance costs in mining fleet operations
- AI-driven behavioral monitoring enables proactive identification of practices that accelerate asset degradation
- Digital twin and simulator technologies reduce training-related equipment wear and damage risk
- Integrated technology approach supports data-driven decision-making for fleet management
- Aligns with predictive maintenance by correlating driver behavior patterns with equipment condition
