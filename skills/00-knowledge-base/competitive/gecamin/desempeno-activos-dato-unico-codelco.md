# Desempeno de Activos a Traves del Dato Unico

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Jorge Hidalgo (Codelco - Gerencia Corporativa de Mantenimiento)
- **Session:** S9 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Codelco's corporate-wide initiative to standardize asset performance indicators through a single authoritative data source ("dato unico"), enabling cross-divisional benchmarking and best practice transfer across 8 mining divisions.

## Key Points
- **Codelco context:** Largest copper producer (6.4% of world production, 1.42 million tonnes in 2023), 8 divisions + 1 corporate center, 15,638 total equipment (14% high criticality, 34% medium, 52% low), 71,630 personnel (22% own, 78% contractors).
- **The problem:**
  - No official corporate time model existed; only an unofficial model was used between divisions.
  - Different time models existed at divisional and process levels.
  - Indicator comparison between divisions was impossible due to discrepant time models, preventing synergy capture.
  - Diverse platforms (some manual) for recording and calculating indicators, creating data integrity risks and poor information availability.
- **Key findings during diagnostic:**
  - Differences in how downtime is classified.
  - Differences in calculation criteria for systemic and fleet indicators.
  - Loss of information traceability due to manual calculations.
- **Objectives:**
  1. Standardize downtime classification for mine and plant assets.
  2. Standardize criteria and methodologies for calculating systemic and fleet indicators (Availability, Utilization, Operating Coefficient).
  3. Democratize asset performance information with a corporate perspective for best practice transfer through the single data point.
- **Standardized time model:**
  - **Nominal Time** = Available Time + Out of Service Time (Programmed + Non-Programmed)
  - **Available Time** = Effective Time + Operational Losses + Delays + Programmed/Non-Programmed Maintenance
  - **Three key indicators:** Availability = Available/Nominal; Utilization (UEBD) = Effective/Available; Operating Coefficient (CM) = Effective/Nominal.
- **Implementation approach:** Phased rollout by productive process:
  - Completed: Concentrator, Underground Mine, Hydrometallurgy, Smelting/Refining + Roasting.
  - In progress: Open-Pit Mine.
  - Data sources: FMS and "dictionaries" for mines, SEP4 for plants.
- **Results to date:**
  - 500+ operators and maintainers trained.
  - SEP4 system deployed.
  - 8 training capsules and infographics created (U Codelco Maintenance Academy).
  - 4 standards collaboratively developed (Open-Pit Mine, Underground Mine, Hydro-Concentrator Plants, Smelting/Refining-Roasting Plants).
  - 2 Asset Portals deployed (Mines and Plants) providing executive view of global asset performance.
- **Key conclusions:**
  - Codelco now has a standardized corporate time model for every productive phase, enabling direct process comparison.
  - Data is unique, official, and accessible to the entire corporation.
  - The framework is scalable and serves as an enabler for advanced analytics.
  - Success required both top-down sponsorship and bottom-up engagement ("1% technical, 99% adaptive").
  - Collaborative standard development facilitated implementation.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- This is a foundational asset management capability: without consistent, standardized performance measurement, no benchmarking, improvement targeting, or best practice transfer is possible.
- The "dato unico" concept directly addresses one of the most common problems in large mining organizations: inconsistent KPI definitions across sites.
- The standardized time model (Availability, Utilization, Operating Coefficient) is aligned with international standards and enables meaningful corporate dashboards.
- The phased, collaborative approach to standardization is a replicable change management model for any multi-site mining company.
- Positions Codelco for advanced analytics and AI by establishing a clean, consistent data foundation.
- The insight that transformation is "1% technical and 99% adaptive" is a critical lesson for any digital transformation initiative.
