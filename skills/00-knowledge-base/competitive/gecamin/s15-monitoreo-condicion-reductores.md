# Monitoreo de Condicion en Reductores

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Pablo Rodenas (HYDAC)
- **Session:** S15 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Condition monitoring strategies for industrial gearboxes (reducers) in mining, focusing on oil analysis, contamination control, and online monitoring to transition from reactive to proactive maintenance.

## Key Points
- **Gearboxes in mining are:** high-cost components, complex to work on, process bottlenecks, and prone to unexpected failures causing unplanned downtime
- **Four key monitoring objectives:**
  1. Increase system availability (reduce unplanned stops, improve reliability)
  2. Sustainable resource consumption (extend oil life, change only when necessary)
  3. System quality improvement (better cleanliness levels for critical components)
  4. Reduce life cycle costs
- **Maintenance strategy maturity:** Reactive < Preventive < Predictive < Proactive -- each level improves performance
- **Fault detection timeline:** Oil lab analysis detects earliest (weeks-months ahead), followed by acoustic emission, vibration analysis, audible noise, temperature increase, and finally total failure
- **Online monitoring detects faults much earlier** than periodic lab analysis
- **Contamination sources:**
  - Original system contamination (production/assembly residues)
  - Self-generated contamination (component wear, oil degradation, chemical processes)
  - Environmental contamination (maintenance activities, damaged seals, faulty cooling systems)
- **Contamination consequences:** Component failure, imprecise control, low system efficiency, accelerated wear, oxidation/corrosion, cavitation damage, filter clogging, reduced fluid life
- **Root causes of premature failures:** Component defects, incorrect startup/maintenance, wrong operating conditions, design failures (incorrect filtration/cooling), extreme environmental conditions
- **Monitoring methodology:**
  - Ferric and non-ferric wear particle analysis
  - Oil contamination analysis (ISO 4406:2021)
  - Oil quality analysis
  - Recommended frequency: every 3 months minimum, or online for continuous monitoring
- **Data management chain:** Machine-level acquisition, local storage, cloud/data center transmission, alarm generation
- **Critical insight:** Correct measurements and maintenance strategy are not enough -- the right person must receive the data in time to make decisions
- HYDAC provides integration kits for early fault detection systems

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Gearboxes are among the most expensive and critical components in mining processing plants -- their failure has cascading effects on production
- The presentation makes a strong case for transitioning from periodic oil sampling to continuous online monitoring
- ISO 4406:2021 provides a standardized framework for contamination measurement and target setting
- Emphasizes the importance of the information delivery chain -- data must reach decision-makers promptly
- The contamination source analysis helps maintenance teams develop targeted contamination control strategies
- Directly supports reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) programs focused on gearbox health
