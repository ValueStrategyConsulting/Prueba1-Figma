# External Mill Maintenance Robot (EMMR): Revolucionando el Cambio de Revestimientos de Molinos en Mineria

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Leonardo Basaul Flores, Francisco Salamanca Poblete (MIRS - Mining & Heavy Industry Robotics)
- **Session:** S11 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Robotic system for automated mill relining that eliminates worker risk exposure and reduces reline times by 12-20%

## Key Points
- Mill relining is one of the most critical concentrator plant tasks: manual process with high safety risks and low productivity
- MIRS strategic vision: "No Man on the Mill" through robotics and artificial intelligence
- Three-robot portfolio: TMMR (Trommel), EMMR (External), IMMR (Internal - under development)
- EMMR components: Main Robot Platform, Power Strike, Power Drive Electric, Power Cut, Tool Rack, Robotic Feeder, Machine Vision System
- Machine Vision uses deep learning (50-layer ResNet) trained on 25,000+ images for bolt/nut/washer/hole recognition in 0.8 seconds
- 3D matching uses point cloud analysis to find CAD model geometry matches in 2 seconds
- Proven operational track record: 11 relining campaigns from 2020-2024 across 4 clients
- Totals: 1,144 bolt extractions, 955 bolt removals, 929 bolt installations across 349 pieces
- Workforce reduction from 29 per shift (conventional) to 9 per shift (EMMR)
- Complete elimination of major safety risks: work at height, hot work (nut cutting), impact wrench injuries, hammer injuries, finger entrapment
- Quality information: 100% automatic dimensional control, extraction torque, torque curves, process times, and torque control (vs. occasional/manual with conventional)
- When used in all positions, EMMR can reduce planned relining times by 12-20%
- Modular design adaptable for different mills in the plant, for both traditional and external bolting

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Robotic relining directly addresses the #1 planned maintenance bottleneck in concentrator plants
- 12-20% reduction in relining time translates to significant increase in mill availability and production
- 100% automated quality data capture enables reliability analysis of liner installation quality
- Elimination of human factors in critical bolting operations improves consistency and reduces rework
- Workforce reduction from 29 to 9 per shift addresses the growing challenge of skilled labor availability in mining
