# Sectorflex Green - Cable Ecologico para la Mineria Subterranea

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Angela Bastidas (Prysmian Group)
- **Session:** S8 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Introduction of Sectorflex Green, the first ecological cable for underground mining featuring plant-based insulation, sectoral conductor design, and halogen-free construction, reducing diameter, weight, and carbon footprint.

## Key Points
- **Industry context:** Mining sustainability challenges are increasingly tied to both safety and environmental responsibility. The evolution from diesel shovels to electric and hybrid shovels illustrates the electrification trend.
- **Product: SECTORFLEX GREEN (RZ1-k designation):**
  - First ecological cable specifically designed for underground mining.
  - Incorporates plant-based (vegetable-origin) insulation material.
  - Halogen-free construction.
  - Outer sheath contains a 100% renewable vegetable-origin compound.
  - SEC certified (Chilean electrical standards) with RZ1-k classification.
  - Compliant with new RIC technical standards for occupied spaces, ducts, trays, ladders, open-air and underground installation.
- **Design innovation:** Three-phase sectoral (non-circular) conductors plus circular ground wire, eliminating void spaces between conductors that exist in traditional circular conductor configurations. Available from 75 mm2 cross-section upward.
- **Key advantages:**
  - **12% smaller diameter** (average) due to eliminated inter-conductor voids.
  - **6% lower weight** (average) across configurations and cross-sections.
  - **Easier installation:** Occupies less space on trays, passes more easily through conduits, requires smaller bending radius and less pulling force.
  - **Longer cable life:** Less damage during installation due to better handling, lower bending stress, and reduced spring-back effect.
  - **Standard terminals and accessories:** Once insulation is stripped, conductor becomes circular, allowing identical terminal installation processes and tools.
  - **Identical electrical performance:** Same resistance, same current capacity as circular conductor cables.
  - **Reduced carbon footprint:** Less material, less energy in manufacturing.
  - **Less waste and storage:** Smaller volume means less bodega/warehouse space required.
- **Prysmian Group:** Global cable manufacturer with 50+ countries, 108 plants, 26 R&D centers, 30,000+ workers, EUR 15B+ annual sales, 5 cable-laying ships.
- **Proven in:** Buildings, underground mines, and open-pit mines.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Cable infrastructure is a critical but often overlooked asset class in underground mining; longer cable life directly reduces replacement frequency and associated maintenance costs.
- The 12% diameter reduction and 6% weight reduction translate into lower installation labor costs and improved space utilization in constrained underground environments.
- Halogen-free construction improves safety in underground fire scenarios by eliminating toxic gas generation.
- The sustainability angle (vegetable-based insulation, reduced carbon footprint) aligns with mining companies' ESG commitments and regulatory trends.
- Standard terminal compatibility eliminates retraining and retooling costs during adoption.
- Relevant for electrical maintenance planning and infrastructure lifecycle management in underground operations.
