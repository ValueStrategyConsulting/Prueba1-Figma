# Caso de Exito: Monitoreo Inalambrico de Condiciones en Harneros Vibratorios

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Victor Juliet, Ciro Graziano (Nicolaides Industrial, Chile), John Tschritter (ROSTA AG, Switzerland)
- **Session:** S2 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Successful implementation of ROSTA-DIGITAL wireless condition monitoring system on vibrating screens in Chilean mining, demonstrating how real-time synchronous measurement across four bearing points diagnoses performance deviations.

## Key Points
- Vibrating screens (harneros) are indispensable in mineral grinding and volumetric classification processes
- Manual predictive monitoring on screens is impossible due to vibration exposure risk; existing wired solutions are unsustainable during regular production
- Production loss per hour for a screen in mining installations ranges from USD 45,000 to USD 120,000 depending on equipment and capacity (excluding maintenance costs and parts)
- ROSTA-DIGITAL solution architecture: 4 magnetic harvester sensors per screen, 1 transceiver per screen, 1 base box/gateway (220VAC), router sending live data to monitoring software via Internet/LAN
- Key sensor advantages: self-charging from screen vibration, real-time synchronization (<=5 microseconds between 4 sensors), zero maintainability, internal storage, battery backup, plug-and-play installation
- Parameters measured: amplitude/stroke (mm), acceleration (g), working angle (degrees), lateral displacement (mm), temperature, RPM, signal strength
- Case study on WEIR DHG24/61 linear screen (manufactured 2013) in Vallenar, Chile, measured August 29 - September 16, 2024
- Factory specifications: 45-degree working angle, 9.5mm stroke, 4.4g acceleration, 931 RPM
- Critical findings: working angle deviation >30%, stroke up to 61% below factory value, acceleration >30% below spec, uneven separation effect across the four support points
- Root causes identified: screen weight including material exceeding initial values (flow rate increased over time without adjustments), unbalanced masses adjusted to reduce centrifugal force
- Recommendations: investigate drive deviations, adjust drive to specified values, re-measure, potentially replace springs with ROSTA elements for full capacity
- Analysis supported by ROSTA (80 years of screen expertise) and Nicolaides remote monitoring center (15+ years in condition monitoring)

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates high-value wireless IoT condition monitoring for critical mining equipment with clear ROI (USD 45K-120K/hour production loss avoidance)
- Self-powered sensors with zero maintenance represent the ideal condition monitoring technology for harsh mining environments
- Real-time dashboard with trend analysis and deviation from factory specs is a model for asset performance management software features
- The case study shows how continuous monitoring data enables root cause analysis and data-driven maintenance decisions
- Integration of OEM expertise (ROSTA) with local monitoring services (Nicolaides) illustrates the condition monitoring service ecosystem
