# Gestion de Activos de Infraestructura: Un Enfoque Sistematico

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Javier Palma, Omar Mejias
- **Session:** S1 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Systematic framework for managing mining infrastructure assets across their full lifecycle, addressing the critical challenge of aging processing plants in Chilean copper mining.

## Key Points
- One of the most significant hazards in mining is partial or total collapse of industrial infrastructure, which can cause fatalities and massive economic losses
- Risk increases proportionally with the aging of installations
- Chilean copper mining produces 40% of world supply (~6 Mt projected for 2025), contributing 14.6% of GDP
- Average age of mining operations in Chile is 35 years; design life for processing plants averages 25 years
- 47% of copper processing plants have been operating for more than 25 years -- a critical aging infrastructure problem
- The presentation proposes a comprehensive Infrastructure Management Model covering the full asset lifecycle: Investigation, Design, Acquisition, Construction, Operation & Maintenance, and Closure
- Key lifecycle phases addressed: Maintainability, Control, Processes & Organization, Maintenance, Remediation/Restoration, and Life Extension
- The management model is built on four pillars: Asset Management Policy, Business Processes, Organizational Structure, and Monitoring & Control
- Business processes are structured in 4 levels: from corporate functions (L1) down to detailed activities with KPIs (L4)
- Structural integrity must be considered from investment stages: structural capacity, materials selection, environmental conditions, load requirements, expected useful life, maintainability, reliability, initial criticality and risk analysis
- During operations: ERP maintenance plans, specialized organizational structures, work management, load maps, change control, mitigation plans, infrastructure restoration, and document control throughout the lifecycle
- End-of-life alternatives include: adaptive reuse, historic preservation, sustainable reconversion, or dismantling
- Technology enablers: real-time sensors, drones for inspections, machine learning for failure prediction, digital twins, structural health monitoring software, early warning systems
- Maturity model with 6 phases: Diagnosis (Phase 0), Design & Standardization (Phase 1), Implementation (Phase 2), Optimization (Phase 3), Innovation (Phase 4), Excellence (Phase 5)

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Directly addresses infrastructure asset management with a systematic lifecycle approach aligned with ISO 55000 principles
- The aging infrastructure problem (47% of plants beyond design life) creates urgent demand for asset management software that can track structural health, plan maintenance, and support life extension decisions
- The 4-level business process framework provides a blueprint for how asset management software should be structured
- Digital twin integration and structural health monitoring represent key software opportunities
- The maturity model provides a roadmap for organizations to assess and improve their infrastructure management capabilities
