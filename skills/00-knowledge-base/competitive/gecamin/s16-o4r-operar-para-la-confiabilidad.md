# O4R - Operar para la Confiabilidad

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Ronald Brantt P.
- **Session:** S16 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Operate for Reliability (O4R) methodology that establishes how operating practices directly impact equipment reliability, maintenance costs, and availability, with a structured process for monitoring and improving operator behavior.

## Key Points
- **Core question:** Is the way equipment is operated important for maintenance?
- **Four categories of maintenance demand and their predictability:**
  1. **Scheduled Maintenance (MP):** Predictable, safe, predictable costs
  2. **Component Replacement (TBO):** Predictable, low risk, predictable costs based on Time Between Overhaul
  3. **Unscheduled Maintenance (MNP):** Unpredictable
  4. **Operational Damage (DO):** Unpredictable, high risk
- **Impact of operational damage on availability:**
  - Good O4R: Availability 87.5%, Operational Damage 2.4%
  - Poor O4R: Availability 83.9%, Operational Damage 6.0%
  - The 3.6% availability difference is directly attributable to how equipment is operated
- **O4R is important because it reduces:** Quantity of damage events and accelerated wear events
- **O4R Process consists of six pillars:**
  1. **Awareness:** Appropriation of O4R principles and their impact on fleet performance
  2. **Monitoring:** Real-time event monitoring through IROC (Integrated Remote Operations Center)
  3. **Feedback:** Direct feedback to operators; automatic feedback from IROC and supervisors including routines
  4. **Escalation:** Integration of dashboards with trend information
  5. **Reporting:** Specific follow-up support for equipment operators
  6. **Training:** Targeted training based on monitoring data
- **Monitoring systems used:**
  - Online structural damage monitoring for trucks (chassis stress, speed, inclination, deformation modeling)
  - Online structural damage monitoring for shovels (identification, training, operational improvement)
  - Equipment vital signs monitoring
  - Online diesel engine monitoring
  - Tire monitoring
  - Machine Learning applications
- **Benefits achieved:**
  - Lower corrective maintenance workload
  - Comfortable equipment operation
  - 10% maintenance reduction
  - Chassis life extended to 120,000 hours
  - Improved safety (reduced maintainer exposure)
  - Improved productivity
  - Progress toward "zero damage" goal
  - Extended TBO for system components
  - Reduced costs
  - Established routine communication between maintenance and operations

## Relevance to Asset Management
- O4R bridges the critical gap between operations and maintenance -- operator behavior is a major determinant of equipment life and maintenance costs
- The 3.6% availability difference between good and poor O4R practices translates to millions of dollars in production value for a typical mining fleet
- Real-time monitoring and immediate operator feedback creates a continuous improvement loop that traditional maintenance approaches miss
- Machine learning integration suggests evolution toward predictive operator coaching
- The methodology aligns with Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) principles of operator involvement in equipment care
- Applicable to any mining operation with heavy mobile equipment (trucks, shovels, loaders)
