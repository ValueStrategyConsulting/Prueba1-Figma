# Mineria 4.0 - Paradas de Planta Optimizadas con Tecnologia para Mejorar Eficiencia y Reducir Costos

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Roberto Verdugo (Andes Agile Chile), Ashkan Shahmir
- **Session:** S16 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Cloud-based digital solution for optimizing planned plant maintenance shutdowns (PPMs) in mining, using PDCA methodology with real-time data collection and dashboards to improve plant utilization and reduce costs.

## Key Points
- **Andes Agile** is based in Melbourne with presence in Chile, Peru, and Mexico, serving mining in Latin America and Australia
- **Core problem:** Plants often do not reach production potential due to low availability caused by prolonged shutdowns and post-shutdown failures
- **Root causes of poor shutdown performance:** Delays, inconsistent processes, lack of data visibility, poor coordination, lack of standards, limited information access leading to bottlenecks and reactive decisions
- **Solution methodology (PDCA-based):**
  - **Plan:** Shutdown calendar activates the process -- preparation, execution, and post-shutdown phases
  - **Do:** Complete weekly preparation activities, execute shutdown works, complete post-shutdown tasks
  - **Check:** Monitor KPIs (leadership, execution, and delay indicators)
  - **Act:** Manage corrective actions and close performance gaps
- **Key solution features:**
  1. Preparation, execution, and post-shutdown compliance tracking
  2. Heat map dashboard for monitoring all shutdowns in the preparation horizon
  3. Action definition, assignment, and tracking with overdue notifications
- **Implementation approach:**
  1. Strategic planning with emphasis on exhaustive PPM preparation
  2. Cloud platform deployment across entire organization
  3. Elimination of spreadsheets as the primary management tool
  4. Mobile device integration for field supervisors
  5. Real-time data collection on PPM progress
- **Case study results (Gold mine):**
  - 3% improvement in plant utilization in FY2022
  - Over USD 10 million in savings
  - Full visibility and transparency achieved
  - Increased productivity due to intuitive solution
- **Key benefits:** Process simplification, data visibility for better decisions, real-time updates for transparency and collaboration, significant cost savings, end-to-end coverage of the shutdown process, rapid and cost-effective implementation

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Planned plant shutdowns are among the highest-impact maintenance events -- even small improvements in duration yield massive production gains
- The USD 10M+ savings case demonstrates the ROI potential of digitizing shutdown management
- Replacing spreadsheets with a cloud platform addresses a common maturity gap in mining shutdown management
- The PDCA-based approach aligns with ISO 55000 continuous improvement principles
- Mobile integration for supervisors ensures real-time field data capture, reducing the gap between planning and execution
- Applicable to any mining operation with periodic plant shutdowns (concentrators, SX-EW, leach plants)
