# Sistema Quick Release - Un Cambio en la Mantenibilidad de las Bombas Centrifugas de Pulpa

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Rodolfo Bernhardt (FLS / FLSmidth)
- **Session:** S16 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Innovative Quick Release system by FLSmidth that enables rapid wet-end module replacement in slurry centrifugal pumps, dramatically reducing maintenance time in concentrator plants.

## Key Points
- **Slurry centrifugal pumps** operate in any service class; the only question is for how long before wear requires maintenance
- **Main pump components:** Wet End, Pedestal, Bearing housing
- **Key wear elements:** Impeller, casing, suction and stuffing box liners -- all in contact with mineral slurry undergo natural wear
- **Maintainability defined as:** The probability of restoring a system to service within a determined time after a failure or interruption
- **Three maintenance strategies compared:**
  1. **In-position parts replacement** -- Replace individual wear parts at the operating location
  2. **Complete pump (bareshaft) replacement** -- Swap entire pump assembly
  3. **Quick Release module replacement** -- Swap the complete Wet End module
- **Quick Release system design:**
  - Enables complete Wet End disassembly in three simple steps
  - Uses a split-shaft design that allows rapid disconnection
  - Includes dedicated storage and transport bases for pre-assembled modules
  - Specialized lifting tools and rigging provided
  - **Result: 89 hours of maintenance time saved per pump per year** compared to traditional methods
- **Implemented at real mining operations:**
  - UMD700 at a mine in Chile's Second Region (Antofagasta area)
  - UMD800 at a mine in Chile's Fourth Region (Coquimbo area)
- The modular approach allows wet-end rebuilds to happen in a controlled workshop environment rather than in the field

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Directly addresses maintainability -- one of the key pillars of asset management alongside reliability and availability
- The 89-hour annual savings per pump translates to significant availability improvement in plants with dozens of slurry pumps
- Modular maintenance strategy reduces Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) and improves planned maintenance execution
- Workshop-based module rebuilds improve quality and safety compared to in-situ repairs
- The system supports a shift from corrective to planned preventive maintenance by making replacements faster and more predictable
- Applicable to all concentrator plants with slurry pump circuits (rougher, cleaner, regrind, tailings)
