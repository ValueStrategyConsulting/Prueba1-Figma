# Analisis de Reemplazo Economico en Camiones Usando Modelos Financieros

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Adolfo Casilla Vargas
- **Session:** S8 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Application of Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis and economic replacement models to determine optimal replacement timing for haul trucks in petroleum services, using Net Present Value (NPV) and Cost Annual Equivalent (CAE) methodologies.

## Key Points
- **Core thesis:** "The objective is not to replace, the objective is to propose solutions or improvements that help minimize costs and generate high profitability for the business."
- **Normative foundation:** UNE-EN-60300-3-3 (Life Cycle Cost Analysis) and ISO 15663. The primary purpose is to provide decision criteria across all phases of the asset lifecycle.
- **Key questions addressed:**
  - When to buy a new equivalent equipment?
  - How to determine if current equipment remains profitable?
  - Lease renewal vs. purchase vs. repair decisions?
  - Where to implement cost reduction strategies?
- **Lifecycle economics framework:**
  - **Economic life:** Maximizes profit (optimal replacement point).
  - **Service life:** Period of minimum gains.
  - **Physical life:** Absolute wear/depletion.
  - Formula: SALES - COSTS = PROFITS, with replacement at the point of maximum value.
- **Methodology (ARE Program):**
  1. Select the asset.
  2. Define the most relevant cost categories.
  3. Project the cost flow over time.
  4. Use the ARE (Analysis of Replacement and Economics) program.
  5. Analyze replacement results and cost breakdowns.
- **Case study - PETROL (petroleum services company, southern Argentina):**
  - Fleet: 20 Iveco Eurocargo 170E22 trucks.
  - Acquisition cost: USD 90,000 per unit.
  - Discount rate: 10%.
  - Projection period: 15 years.
  - Cost categories analyzed: corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance, miscellaneous maintenance, workshop maintenance, fuel consumption, and resale value.
- **Financial model:**
  - NPV formula applied with discount rate to all future O&M costs minus resale value.
  - CAE (Cost Annual Equivalent) calculated for each year to find the minimum.
  - Resale value projected using Sivanich (2005) depreciation equation.
- **Results:**
  - Total NPV: USD 300,110.
  - Minimum CAE: USD 39,439/year at year 14.
  - Company-proposed replacement: year 12. Optimal replacement: year 14. **Remaining economic life: 2 years positive.**
  - Compared to current year (year 8): **6 years of positive remaining life.**
  - Cost breakdown: Fuel = 53.2%, Acquisition = 30%, Corrective maintenance = 11.9%, Miscellaneous = 2.7%, Workshop = 2.5%, Preventive = 0.5%.
  - **Conclusion:** Third-party maintenance outsourcing strategy is effective, extending economic life beyond manufacturer recommendation.
  - **Recommendation:** Invest in fuel consumption optimization projects (53% of lifecycle cost).

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Provides a rigorous, quantitative framework for the fundamental asset management question: repair, replace, or extend?
- The CAE (EUAC - Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost) method is a standard tool for optimal replacement analysis, directly applicable to any fleet-intensive operation.
- Demonstrates that outsourced maintenance can extend economic life beyond OEM recommendations when properly managed.
- The cost breakdown analysis (fuel = 53%) reveals where the largest optimization opportunities lie, guiding strategic investment.
- The ARE program/tool could be adapted for any mobile equipment fleet in mining or heavy industry.
- Aligns with ISO 55000 principles of lifecycle value optimization and evidence-based decision making.
