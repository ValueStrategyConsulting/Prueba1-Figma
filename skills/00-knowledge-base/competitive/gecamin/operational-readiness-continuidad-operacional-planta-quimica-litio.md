# Operational Readiness para el Resguardo de la Continuidad Operacional en Planta Quimica de Litio

## Metadata
- **Authors:** David Silva, Cristian Ramirez Castro
- **Session:** S6 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Implementation of Operational Readiness (OR) methodology to protect operational continuity during expansion of a lithium chemical plant from 70 KTPA to 180 KTPA.

## Key Points
- The lithium market is experiencing rapid growth driven by EV batteries, energy storage, and electronics demand, with projections extending to 2035.
- The plant grew from 70 KTPA to 180 KTPA production capacity, requiring a 30% increase in the asset fleet, creating significant risk to operational continuity.
- Traditional project handover methods were insufficient; Operational Readiness (OR) was adopted as a more structured framework for integrating new assets into operations.
- OR provides better connection with project areas, improved resource utilization, and smoother project-to-operations handover.
- Six pillars were developed within the OR framework:
  1. **Assets:** Creation and modification of asset trees.
  2. **Criticality:** Define and redefine criticality with multidisciplinary process review.
  3. **Strategies:** Creation of maintenance strategies by equipment family and special equipment.
  4. **Maintenance Plans:** Work plans, maintenance plans, balance and equalization.
  5. **Spare Parts:** Bill of materials, PEM spares, first 2 years of spares.
  6. **Procedures & Standards:** Identification of required procedures and standards.
- Key lessons learned include: better resource prioritization, early-stage risk mitigation via punch lists, early access to information, cross-functional teamwork, improved maintainability review, and training on specialized equipment.
- Results achieved: availability above 95% and utilization of 85%, optimization of maintenance plans, and reduction in corrective maintenance costs by decreasing premature failures.
- Next steps: advance OR involvement from pre-commissioning to detailed engineering phase to improve training management, early spare parts availability review, and information transfer through dedicated platforms.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates a structured approach to integrating new assets into existing operations without compromising availability or reliability.
- The OR framework aligns with ISO 55000 lifecycle management principles by engaging maintenance from the earliest project stages.
- Provides a practical template for any mining operation undergoing capacity expansion, showing how to manage the transition risk through systematic asset onboarding.
- The six-pillar model (assets, criticality, strategies, plans, spares, procedures) is a replicable best practice for maintenance readiness.
