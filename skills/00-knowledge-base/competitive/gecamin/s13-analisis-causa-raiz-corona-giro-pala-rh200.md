- **Authors:** Carlos Araya Carmona (Carmen de Andacollo / Teck - Quebrada Blanca)
- **Session:** S13 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Root cause analysis of premature severe damage to swing ring gear on Terex RH-200 hydraulic excavator

## Key Points
- Carmen de Andacollo: open-pit copper mine, 90% Teck ownership, Coquimbo Region, Chile
- Terex RH-200 hydraulic excavator (Pala S-03): experienced premature severe damage to swing ring gear
- Damage profile: 25% of crown perimeter shows severe tooth material loss; 75% shows crushing on both tooth faces
- Failure sequence over equipment life:
  - 2012 (26,500 hrs): swing bearing failure, roller failures
  - 2020 (61,838 hrs): 900mm frontal carbody crack detected
  - 2021 (64,298 hrs): stick fracture at cylinder housing
  - 2021 (65,084/65,980 hrs): two adapter breakages while working untronated front (Phase 6)
  - 2021 (38,300 hrs new crown): severe crown damage
  - 2022 (4,221 hrs new crown): premature severe crown damage - identical failure mode
- Root cause analysis using fault tree methodology with four hypothesis branches:
  1. Manufacturing deviation: pinion/crown hardness out of specification, material quality issues
  2. Lubrication problems: contamination, specification non-compliance, insufficient quantity
  3. Irregular load concentration: excessive axial play, reducer misalignment, internal bearing wear, seating deformation
  4. Structural deformation: bolt torque loss on crown/bearing, cumulative operational overload
- Key latent factors identified:
  - Operating procedure P-CYT-17 did not contain manufacturer's operational limits
  - No inclinometer installed to monitor maximum 5-degree tilt limit
  - Equipment exceeded 90-degree swing limit
  - Working in untronated or in-situ fronts caused excessive structural stress
  - No protocol for geometric verification during reducer replacement
  - No risk control protocol to mitigate structural effects
- High-precision measurement and structural evaluation conducted during investigation
- Recommendations included procedure updates, operational limits enforcement, and structural monitoring

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates how cumulative operational overloads create cascading structural failures in large mining equipment
- Root cause analysis methodology (fault tree) systematically identifies physical, human, and latent organizational factors
- Highlights the critical importance of operating within OEM-specified parameters for high-value assets
- Shows how inadequate procedures and missing instrumentation (inclinometer) allow progressive structural degradation
- Case study applicable to any organization managing hydraulic excavators or large rotating equipment
