# Especializacion en Control y Mejora de los Combustibles Diesel-Biodiesel en Mineria

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Pablo Rodenas (HYDAC)
- **Session:** S15 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Specialized methodology for controlling and improving diesel/biodiesel fuel quality in mining operations, addressing contamination that causes equipment failures and unplanned downtime.

## Key Points
- Diesel is the most consumed consumable in mining operations; biodiesel blends add complexity (EU standard: B7)
- **Three main fuel contamination problems:** solid particulates, water ingress, and "diesel pest" (microbial growth)
- The entire distribution chain is susceptible to contamination entry
- Modern engines (common-rail, tighter mechanical tolerances) are more sensitive to contaminants than older engines
- **OEM cleanliness requirements (ISO 4406):**
  - Bosch injectors: 12/09/07
  - CAT common rail: max 16/13/11, <500ppm free water
  - MTU tanks: 18/17/14, 200 mg/kg water
- **Scale of the problem:** A gold mine consuming 40 million liters/year with ISO 21/19/17 diesel receives approximately 800 kg of particulates and 20,000 liters of water annually
- On-board filtration alone is insufficient; off-board fuel conditioning is required
- **Methodology consists of three pillars:**
  1. Solid particle reduction through quality filtration with stable beta ratios
  2. Water content reduction using two-phase separation systems (hydrophobic + hydrophilic barriers)
  3. Online monitoring vs. laboratory analysis (online recommended per ISO 12669)
- **Case study (Asian mine):** 360,000 liters/day consumption; 50% improvement in filter element life; cost reduction of 500,000 EUR/year per station; 3 stations improved
- **KPI tracking** shows reduction from critical situation to measurable decrease in failure events, lost time, and production losses

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Fuel quality is an often-overlooked factor in mining equipment reliability; contaminated diesel directly impacts MTBF of haul trucks and mobile equipment
- Provides a clear methodology for fuel management that can be integrated into asset management strategies
- The cost-benefit case is compelling: fuel conditioning systems pay for themselves through reduced engine failures, extended component life, and fewer unplanned stops
- Online monitoring enables proactive maintenance of fuel systems rather than reactive approaches
- Directly applicable to any mining operation with diesel-powered fleet (haul trucks, loaders, generators)
