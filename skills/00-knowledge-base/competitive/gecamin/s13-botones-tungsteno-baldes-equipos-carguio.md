- **Topic:** Tungsten carbide button technology (TungStuds) for wear protection on loading equipment buckets, reducing maintenance interventions

## Key Points
- Challenge: reduce wear and unplanned events on buckets of loading equipment (Komatsu 4100XPC, PC8000, L2350, Caterpillar 7495)
- Comparison of three protection technologies:
  - Original Wear Pads: ~60% lip coverage, ~400 kg/m2, ~700 HB hardness, 3x normalized life
  - Chockybars: ~40% coverage, ~250 kg/m2, ~600 HB, 2x life (both welded)
  - TungStuds BT94M: 100% coverage, 43 kg/m2, ~1,250 HB hardness, 5x life (electro-fusion bonding)
- TungStuds are 94% tungsten carbide, extremely resistant to temperature, corrosion, and impact
- Pilot 2021 results: only ~2.4 mm wear after 30 Mton on 4100XPC-DC Optima bucket
- Complete elimination of structural breakdowns caused by blindage loss and volume depletion
- Significant reduction in PM01/PM03 SAP work orders for bucket repairs
- Historical problem: 3 campaigns of structural repair required per bucket lifecycle
- Detailed savings documented on lip repair, floor and wall blindage, and structural steel replacement
- Next steps: include tungsten button requirements in future procurement specifications
- Expanding use to other fleets (EEAA) and plant applications (chutes, hoppers)
- Acquiring portable installation tools for field application
- Conclusions emphasize: innovation culture, structured test protocols, BTEC methodology, cross-fleet practice transfer

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Tungsten carbide technology delivers 5x wear life improvement at 1/10th the weight of traditional protection
- Elimination of unplanned structural repairs on loading equipment buckets significantly improves fleet availability
- Standardization in procurement specifications ensures wear protection is embedded in the asset lifecycle from acquisition
- Cross-fleet and cross-plant technology transfer multiplies the value capture from a single innovation initiative
- Reduced maintenance interventions on buckets free up maintenance resources for other critical activities
