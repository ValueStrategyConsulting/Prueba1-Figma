# Optimizacion de Costos en Mantenimiento Minero: Estrategias y Herramientas Efectivas

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Guillermo Torrales Aguirre (EY Chile, Mining & Metals Department, South America Division)
- **Session:** S1 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Comprehensive framework comparing 14 maintenance cost optimization strategies and tools across six evaluation criteria, with industry benchmarks suggesting 10-30% cost reduction potential.

## Key Points
- Industry studies suggest maintenance cost optimization can achieve 10-30% reduction depending on technology, data analytics, inventory management, service contracts, and safety improvements
- **8 Optimization Strategies identified:**
  1. Preventive Maintenance -- High cost reduction, high efficiency, medium investment, high ROI
  2. Predictive Maintenance -- High cost reduction, very high efficiency, high investment, high ROI
  3. Spare Parts Management -- Medium cost reduction, low-medium investment
  4. Training & Personnel Development -- Medium cost reduction, very positive safety impact
  5. Data Analytics & KPIs -- Medium-high cost reduction, high ROI
  6. Strategic Outsourcing -- Variable across all dimensions
  7. Continuous Improvement (Lean, Six Sigma) -- High cost reduction, very high efficiency, high ease of implementation
  8. Technology & Automation -- Overarching enabler
- **6 Effective Tools identified:**
  1. CMMS -- High cost reduction, very high efficiency, medium-high investment, high ROI
  2. Predictive Analysis Software -- High cost reduction, high investment, high ROI
  3. IoT Sensors & Devices -- High cost reduction, high investment, high ROI
  4. Drones & Robots -- Medium cost reduction, high investment, very positive safety impact, high ease of implementation
  5. Augmented Reality (AR) -- Medium cost reduction, high investment, medium-high ROI
  6. Inventory Management Systems -- Medium cost reduction, medium investment
- **Six evaluation criteria used:** Cost Reduction, Efficiency Improvement, Initial Investment, ROI, Safety Impact, Ease of Implementation
- Highest cost reduction: Preventive maintenance, Predictive maintenance, Lean/Six Sigma, CMMS, Predictive software, IoT sensors
- Highest ROI: Preventive, Predictive, Data/KPIs, Lean/Six Sigma, CMMS, Predictive software, IoT
- Best safety impact: Training (very positive), Drones/Robots (very positive)
- Easiest to implement: Lean/Six Sigma, Drones/Robots
- Key conclusion: CMMS + data analytics + KPIs + IoT + drones + AR integration leads to more informed decision-making and efficient resource allocation
- Strategic outsourcing viable if quality control and SLAs are maintained
- Proactive approach (preventive + predictive) combined with advanced technology and training are key to successful maintenance management

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Provides a structured decision framework for mining companies evaluating asset management software investments (CMMS, predictive analytics, IoT platforms)
- CMMS is ranked as high cost reduction with very high efficiency improvement, reinforcing the value proposition of maintenance management software
- The 10-30% cost reduction benchmark is a powerful selling point for asset management software vendors
- EY (a major consulting firm) presenting this framework validates the business case for digital maintenance tools
- The six-criteria evaluation matrix can be used by software vendors to position their solutions against alternatives
