# Gabinete Smart - Gemelo Digital: Solucion Escalable de Mantenimiento Industrial

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Hugo Barrientos, Antonio Chavez (I&T Solutions)
- **Session:** S14 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Scalable industrial maintenance solution using smart cabinets with digital twin technology, progressing through four implementation stages from QR-based information to full digital twins with real-time monitoring.

## Key Points
- **I&T Solutions** is a Chilean company (founded 2018) specializing in digital transformation for metallic mining, with offices in Santiago and Antofagasta
- Core challenge: Only a small percentage of companies have a digital transformation strategy for equipment reliability and maintenance
- The solution targets **electrical cabinets and their critical assets** as the unit of digital transformation
- **Four-stage implementation model:**
  1. **Stage 1 - QR Information:** Digitized asset data (supplier, SAP code, components, manuals) accessible via QR codes
  2. **Stage 2 - Maintenance Information:** Digital logbooks, chat, databases, work assignment apps, procedures, technical reports
  3. **Stage 3 - 3D Model:** 3D component models, virtual/mixed reality, technical information, remote support
  4. **Stage 4 - Digital Twin:** Real-time information, local web application, anomaly detection and traceability, custom alarms and fault detection, OT cybersecurity, dashboards
- **Remote Expert Support** capability reduces on-site time, improves safety, decreases personnel needs, reduces logistics and errors
- **Custom data logger ("Nlogger"):** Monitors variables via digital, analog, and Modbus channels; stores data in real-time database; supports RS485, Ethernet, WiFi, 3/4/5G, LoRaWAN; API REST integration in JSON format
- **Security:** IEC 62443 standard compliance for OT cybersecurity; VPN and cellular connections
- **Measurable Results:**
  - 50% reduction in human resource costs
  - 53% decrease in wait times
  - 34% reduction in maintenance costs
  - 50% increase in inspection efficiency

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Provides a practical, graduated roadmap for digitizing maintenance of electrical infrastructure in mining
- The staged approach (QR to digital twin) allows operations to start small and scale based on value delivered
- Addresses the common challenge of accessing equipment information in the field
- The Nlogger data acquisition device offers flexible connectivity options critical for remote mining sites
- Demonstrates measurable ROI that can justify digital transformation investments
- Remote expert support model is highly relevant for mining operations in remote locations with limited specialist availability
