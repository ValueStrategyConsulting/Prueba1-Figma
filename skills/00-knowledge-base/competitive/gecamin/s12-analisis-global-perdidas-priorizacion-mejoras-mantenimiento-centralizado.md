# Analisis Global de Perdidas como Herramienta de Priorizacion de Mejoras en Mantenimiento Centralizado

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Alejandro Herrera, Claudio Arroyo, Ronald Galisky
- **Session:** S12 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Global loss analysis methodology for prioritizing maintenance improvements in centralized corporate maintenance organizations

## Key Points
- Motivated by F1 pit stop analogy: difference between worst (9.2 sec) and world record (1.82 sec) comes from coordination, parts readiness, and equipment knowledge
- Context: large mining companies operate centralized maintenance centers (CCP) with varying maturity levels across Chilean operations
- Companies compared: one led from Santiago (50% standardization, advanced), one from London (100%, advanced), one from Melbourne (100%, semi-advanced), one from Vancouver (100%, in development)
- Problem: improvements do not sustain over time, reverting to production losses; repeated reinvestment required; high personnel turnover creates iteration cycles
- Maintenance accounts for ~30% of mining OPEX; fatality rate decreased 83% between 2010-2023
- Loss categorization: Operations (ore grade, utilization, inventory, weather), Maintenance (failures, major maintenance, availability, strategy), Projects (delays)
- ~20% of production losses are due to maintenance factors; within maintenance, 70% of losses are from unplanned failures
- Over $180 MMUSD in losses from unplanned failures; 70% from unforeseen failures in critical equipment
- Top failing equipment: mills, rotopala, conveyors, roasters, trippers, crushers
- Methodology: standardize maintenance plans across all operations using a structured process (diagnosis, strategies, base plan, field validation, implementation, auditable SAP plans)
- Conveyor belt standard developed: activities, admissible limits, secondary activities, recommended frequencies
- Results: +2% reduction in failure losses, $5 MMUSD potential value capture in first year, 400% ROI, 290+ assets standardized, 100% critical conveyor system coverage
- Standardization of BOMs as driver for effective material/spare parts control and ERP/SAP cleanup
- Cultural shift: moving from "working for the KPI" to working for real maturity and process improvement

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates the business case for centralized, corporate-level maintenance strategy standardization
- Global loss analysis provides a data-driven framework for prioritizing maintenance investments across multiple operations
- Addresses the common challenge of maintenance improvements that don't sustain over time
- BOMs standardization drives inventory optimization and duplicate identification across operations
- 400% ROI in first year validates the economic value of structured maintenance standardization programs
