  - N+1 SCR redundancy
- **SmartDisplay** diagnostics: Windows 10-based HMI with operation meters, trends, active faults, traceback reports, block diagrams, SCR diagnostics, I/O monitoring; supports Wi-Fi data download via mobile devices
- **Key advantages:** Low starting currents, lower electrical network stress, process quality improvement, operational flexibility, best efficiency for large motors, retrofit capabilities, remote service, air-cooled, ISO 9001-2015

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Critical technology for mining operations using large synchronous motors in SAG mills, ball mills, and pumps
- The 15-minute MTTR and modular design directly improve equipment availability and reduce maintenance downtime
- Retrofit capability means existing motor installations can be upgraded without full replacement
- SCR redundancy (N+1) provides built-in reliability, reducing unplanned downtime risk
- SmartDisplay diagnostics support condition-based maintenance strategies
- Energy efficiency improvements align with mining industry sustainability and cost reduction goals
