# Avances en el Mantenimiento de Infraestructura Minera: Monitoreo de Estado de Salud de Estructuras

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Rodrigo Ortiz C., Benjamin Correa B-C (Rhenu SpA)
- **Session:** S10 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Structural health monitoring (SHM) platform for mining infrastructure using digital twins, sensors, and cloud-based analytics to enable proactive maintenance and safety.

## Key Points
- Aging mining infrastructure and increasing global incidents drive the need for continuous structural integrity monitoring
- Reduced computational costs have made structural health monitoring viable, effective, and efficient at scale
- The methodology integrates sensor data with digital twins to simulate structural behavior under different operating conditions
- A centralized system uses digital twins combined with theoretical and machine learning approaches to infer asset condition
- Five-step process: (1) Asset checkup and diagnostics, (2) Structural/theoretical modeling, (3) Sensor installation with parameter/alert definitions, (4) Cloud-based 24/7 real-time analysis with dashboard, (5) Alert protocols for possible failures
- Sensor installation uses prefabricated mounting pieces, enabling deployment on a spreader in just a few hours
- Processing pipeline: Rhenu Vibes (sensors) -> Rhenu Forge (data acquisition, analysis, digital twin comparison, alerts) -> RhenuX (visualization)
- Alerts delivered cross-platform via MS Teams, Email, WhatsApp, and in-platform notifications
- Criticality definitions vary by company: one defines critical as "threatens operations for 2+ weeks," another as "threatens EBITDA by 10%+"
- Platform features include: asset alert status, recent events map, event history with Reiher-Meister charts, envelopes, displacement graphs, PSD, FRS frequency analysis

## Case Studies
- **Case 1 - Feed Bridge:** 2-span structure at 45m height with overstressed connections and operator discomfort from vibrations. Accelerometers installed on 16 transverse frames, beams, and columns. Frequency analysis across X, Y, Z axes revealed structural mode patterns.
- **Case 2 - Grinding Mill Feed Conveyor:** Instrumented with 1 accelerometer, 2 strain gauges, and 1 distance sensor. Spectral analysis (PSD) identified dominant frequency bands around 12 Hz and below 5 Hz.
- **Case 3 - Long-span Bridge:** Instrumented with accelerometers, inclinometers, and strain gauges. Integrated weather forecasting (precipitation, isotherm data) into alert decision matrix with color-coded risk levels. Emergency response protocol: (1) HazOp meeting, (2) Performance evaluation during emergency, (3) Service restoration.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates a complete structural health monitoring ecosystem applicable to critical mining infrastructure (bridges, conveyors, spreaders)
- Enables transition from reactive/time-based to condition-based maintenance for structural assets
- Digital twin integration allows comparing real-time sensor data against theoretical models to detect degradation early
- Multi-channel alerting system ensures rapid response to structural anomalies, supporting both safety and operational continuity
- Criticality framework ties structural condition directly to business impact (EBITDA, operational downtime)
