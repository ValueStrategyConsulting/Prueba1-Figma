# Optimizacion de Mantenimiento y Tiempos de Cambio con Revestimientos Hibridos en Molinos SAG

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Edwin Ernesto Mori Montalvo, Juan Eduardo Bustamante
- **Session:** S8 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Comparison of traditional vs. hybrid liner systems in SAG mills, demonstrating a 14.9-hour reduction in relining time per event (worth USD 2.8 million) through elimination of internal bolting and process optimization.

## Key Points
- **Context:** SAG mill relining is one of the highest-impact maintenance activities in a concentrator plant, directly affecting availability. The 2022 benchmark showed availability targets of ~91% were achievable but liner change times were a major constraint.
- **Maintenance impact breakdown:** Mechanical corrective maintenance, electrical corrective maintenance, and programmed maintenance are the three main downtime contributors for SAG mills.
- **Traditional relining process (85.9 hours total):**
  - Chute removal + blockage: 2.0 hrs
  - Torching: 10.0 hrs
  - Dropping/removal: 20.0 hrs
  - Cleaning: 7.5 hrs
  - Mounting: 25.0 hrs
  - Rotation: 8.9 hrs
  - Unforeseen: 4.0 hrs
  - Trommel: 7.0 hrs
  - Chute installation + unblocking: 1.5 hrs
  - Total: 243 pieces, 486 movements, 5.6 movements/hour.
- **Hybrid liner relining process (71.0 hours total):**
  - Torching: 6.0 hrs (was 10.0) - **4 hours saved**
  - Dropping/removal: 17.0 hrs (was 20.0) - **3 hours saved**
  - Cleaning: 5.0 hrs (was 7.5) - **2.5 hours saved**
  - Mounting: 20.0 hrs (was 25.0) - **5 hours saved**
  - Rotation: 6.5 hrs (was 8.9) - **2.4 hours saved**
  - Same piece count but 6.8 movements/hour (vs. 5.6).
- **Key innovation of hybrid liners:**
  - 2-piece design combined into 1-piece, integrating lifter and plate.
  - No internal bolt armers needed.
  - No internal bolts.
  - Reduced number of internal movements.
  - External bolting only, reducing worker risk exposure by 59% (from 100% to 41%).
- **Critical operational considerations:**
  - Mill charge level (JC) must be 22-23% ideal; levels above 24% cause charge to impact the liner during rotation.
  - Rubber backing continuity is important; not all hybrid cylinder pieces come with complete rubber backing, requiring additional cleaning and recoating.
- **Total annual impact:** 29.8 hours saved per year = 0.34% availability improvement = USD 2.8 million per relining event.
- **Safety improvement:** 59% reduction in exposure to bolt-related accident risk during mounting.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- SAG mill relining optimization is one of the highest-value maintenance improvements in mineral processing, directly converting downtime hours into production value.
- Hybrid liners represent a design-for-maintainability improvement, reducing both time and risk without changing the fundamental maintenance approach.
- The detailed time breakdown by process step enables targeted improvement efforts and benchmarking across operations.
- The safety improvement (59% risk reduction) demonstrates that availability optimization and safety improvement can be achieved simultaneously.
- The USD 2.8 million per event value provides a clear ROI for the hybrid liner investment.
- The JC (charge level) optimization insight shows the importance of operational discipline in maintenance execution.
