# Extender las Horas de Utilizacion del Aceite Motor en Camiones y Cargadores

## Metadata
- **Authors:** Arturo Casanga Cortes
- **Session:** S6 MAPLA 2024
- **Topic:** Implementation of extended oil drain intervals for CAT 3500 series engines in haul trucks and loaders at Teck Carmen de Andacollo mine, doubling oil change frequency from 500 to 1000 hours (trucks) and 250 to 500 hours (loaders).

## Key Points
- Arturo Casanga is an Asset Health Engineer at Teck Carmen de Andacollo (CDA), with 15 years of mining experience focused on condition monitoring and asset health.
- The project targeted Caterpillar 3500 series engines in the haul truck and loader fleet at CDA copper mine in Coquimbo Region, Chile.
- **Objective:** Double oil change intervals (trucks: 500 to 1000 hours; loaders: 250 to 500 hours) without impacting the 25,000-hour engine life target.
- A structured methodology was followed:
  1. **Lubricant study:** Identified requirements for TBN stability, additive package stability, OEM specification compliance, and controlled wear parameters.
  2. **Lubricant selection:** Chose Mobil Delvac Elite 15W-40, a semi-synthetic heavy-duty diesel oil meeting CJ-4 specification with extended drain capability.
  3. **Test protocol:** Complete oil flush, continuous monitoring, oil samples sent to 2 laboratories, online monitoring, samples taken every 50 hours, 2-cycle test period.
  4. **Equipment selection:** Selected equipment with 3 different motor component hour intervals and oil consumption below 10% refill rate.
  5. **Communication:** Installed signage on test equipment, conducted training for maintainers, shift supervisors, and planners; modified maintenance schedules.
  6. **Planning:** Integrated into maintenance plan, confirmed lubricant stock, defined changeover date.
- **Key monitored parameters:** Wear metals (ppm) vs. hours, TBN (Total Base Number) behavior, oil refill rates, additive package condition.
- TBN remained within acceptable range (8.49-10.23) throughout the extended period, confirming oil stability.
- **Quantified results:**
  - Truck fleet: Oil consumption reduced from 61,776 to 30,888 liters annually.
  - Loader fleet: Oil consumption reduced from 33,696 to 16,848 liters annually.
  - Filter change savings: $82,080,000 CLP (using 4x 1R-1808 filters per change).
  - Truck oil cost savings: $169,884,000 CLP (390-liter carter capacity).
  - Loader oil cost savings: $92,664,000 CLP.
- Sustainability benefit: significant reduction in waste oil generation and filter disposal.

## Relevance to Asset Management
- Demonstrates a rigorous, data-driven approach to optimizing preventive maintenance intervals, a core asset management practice.
- Shows how oil analysis and condition monitoring can safely extend maintenance intervals, reducing both costs and environmental impact.
- The structured test protocol (dual-lab analysis, online monitoring, controlled equipment selection) is a model for validating maintenance interval changes in any fleet.
- Directly contributes to sustainability goals by reducing lubricant consumption and waste generation.
- The methodology preserves the 25,000-hour engine life target, balancing cost optimization with reliability.
